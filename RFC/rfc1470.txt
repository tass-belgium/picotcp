               FYI on a Network Management Tool Catalog:
          Tools for Monitoring and Debugging TCP/IP Internets
                       and Interconnected Devices

Status of this Memo

   This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does
   not specify an Internet standard.  Distribution of this memo is
   unlimited.

Abstract

   The goal of this FYI memo is to provide an update to FYI 2, RFC 1147
   [1], which provided practical information to site administrators and
   network managers.  New and/or updated tools are listed in this RFC.
   Additonal descriptions are welcome, and should be sent to: noctools-
   entries@merit.edu.

Introduction

   A static document cannot incorporate references to the latest tools
   nor recent revisions to the older catalog entries.  To provide a more
   timely and responsive information source, the NOCtools catalog is
   available on-line via the Internet and Usenet.

      news    comp.networks.noctools
      ftp     wuarchive.wustl.edu:/doc/noctools

   Because of publication delays and other factors, some of the entries
   in this catalog may be out of date.  The reader is urged to consult
   the on-line service to obtain the most up-to-date information.

   The index provided in this document reflects the current contents of
   the on-line documentation.

   The NOCtools2 Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) has compiled this revised catalog.  Future revisions will be
   incorporated into the on-line NOCtools catalog.  The reader is
   encouraged to submit new or revised entries for (near-immediate)
   electronic publication.

   The tools described in this catalog are in no way endorsed by the
   IETF.  For the most part, we have neither evaluated the tools in this
   catalog, nor validated their descriptions.  Most of the descriptions
   of commercial tools have been provided by vendors.  Caveat Emptor.

Acknowledgements

   This catalog is the result of work on the part of the NOCTools2
   Working Group of the User Services Area of the IETF.  The following
   individuals made especially notable contributions: Chris Myers,
   Darren Kinley, Gary Malkin, Mohamed Ellozy, and Mike Patton.

Current Postings

   The current contents of the NOCtools catalog may be retrieved via
   anonymous FTP from wuarchive.wustl.edu.  The entries are stored as
   individual files in the directory /doc/noctools.

"No-Writeups" Appendix

Keywords

   This catalog uses "keywords" for terse characterizations of the
   tools.  Keywords are abbreviated attributes of a tool or its use.  To
   allow cross-comparison of tools, uniform keyword definitions have
   been developed, and are given below.  Following the definitions,
   there is an index of catalog entries by keyword.

Keyword Definitions

   The keywords are always listed in a prefined order, sorted first by
   the general category into which they fall, and then alphabetically.
   The categories that have been defined for management tool keywords
   are:

               o    the general management area to which a tool
                    relates or a tool's functional role;

               o    the network resources or components that are
                    managed;

               o    the mechanisms or methods a tool uses to
                    perform its functions;

               o    the operating system and hardware environment
                    of a tool; and

               o    the characteristics of a tool as a hardware
                    product or software release.

Tool Descriptions

   This section is an updated collection of brief descriptions of tools
   for managing TCP/IP internets.  These entries are in alphabetical
   order, by tool name.

   The entries all follow a standard format.  Immediately after the NAME
   of a tool are its associated KEYWORDS.  Keywords are terse
   descriptions of the purposes or attributes of a tool.  A more

RFC 1470          FYI: Network Management Tool Catalog         June 1993


   detailed description of a tool's purpose and characteristics is given
   in the ABSTRACT section.  The MECHANISM section describes how a tool
   works.  In CAVEATS, warnings about tool use are given.  In BUGS,
   known bugs or bug-report procedures are given.  LIMITATIONS describes
   the boundaries of a tool's capabilities.  HARDWARE REQUIRED and
   SOFTWARE REQUIRED relate the operational environment a tool needs.
   Finally, in AVAILABILITY, pointers to vendors, online repositories,
   or other sources for a tool are given.

   Where tool names conflict, the vendor name is used as well.  For
   example, MITRE, and SNMP Research each submitted an updated
   description of a tool called, "NETMON".  These tools were
   independently developed, are functionally different, and run in
   different environments.  MITRE's tool is listed as "NETMON_MITRE,"
   and the tool from SNMP Research as "NETMON_WINDOWS_SNMP_RESEARCH".

        NAME
                ChameLAN 100

        KEYWORDS
                analyzer, benchmark, debugger, generator, map,
                reference, status, traffic; bridge, DECnet, ethernet,
                FDDI, IP, OSI, NFS, ring; eavesdrop, SNMP, X;
                standalone, UNIX.

        ABSTRACT

                Tekelec's ChameLAN 100 is a portable diagnostic system
                for monitoring and simulation of FDDI, Ethernet and
                Token Ring networks -- simultaneously.  Protocol
                analysis of multiple topologies, as well as mixed
                topoloies simultaneously, is a key feature of
                the product family.  Tekelec's proprietary FDDI
                hardware guarantees complete real-time analysis of
                networks and network components at the full ring
                bandwidth of 125 Mbps.  It passively connects to the
                network and captures 100 percent of the data, measures
                performance and isolates real-time problems.

                The simulation option offers full bandwidth load
                generation that allows you to create and simulate any
                network condition.  It gives you the ability to inject
                errors and misformed frames.  A set of
                confidence tests allow simple evaluation of new
                equipment.  A ring map feature displays network
                topology and status of all nodes via the SMT
                process.

                Monitoring of FDDI, Ethernet and Token Ring allows the
                user to: view network status in real time; view
                network, node, or node pair statistics; capture
                frames; control capture using trigger and filter
                capabilities; view real-time statistics; view captured
                frames in decoded format; and view the last frame
                transmitted by each station.

                The following Real-Time Network Statistics of FDDI,
                Ethernet and Token Ring networks is displayed: frame
                rate, runts, byte rate, jabbers, CRC/align errors, and
                collisions.

                Product developers can use the ChameLAN 100 to observe

                and control various events to help debug their FDDI,
                Ethernet and Token Ring products.  End users can
                perform real-time monitoring to test and
                diagnose problems that may occur when developing,
                installing or managing FDDI, Ethernet and Token Ring
                networks and network products.  End users can use the
                ChameLAN 100 to aid in the installation and
                maintenance of Ethernet and Token Ring networks.  To
                isolate specific network trouble spots the ChameLAN
                100 uses filtering and triggering techniques for data
                capture.  Higher level protocol decode includes
                TCP/IP, OSI and DECnet protocol suites.  Protocol
                decode of IPX, SNMP, XTP, and AppleTalk are also
                supported.  Development of additional protocol decodes
                is also under development.  The ChameLAN 100 family
                also offers a Protocol Management Development System
                (PMDS) that enables users to develop custom protocol
                decode suites.

                The FDDI, Ethernet and Token Ring hardware interfaces
                feature independent processing power.  Real-time data
                is monitored unobtrusively at full bandwidth without
                affecting network activity.  Real-time data may also
                be saved to a 120MB or optional 200MB hard disk drive
                for later analysis.  FDDI data is captured at 125 megabits
                per second (Mbps), Ethernet at 10 Mbps and Token Ring
                at 4 or 16 Mbps.

        MECHANISM
                This portable, standalone unit incorporates the power
                of UNIX, X-Windows and Motif.  Its UNIX-based
                programming interface facilitates development of
                customized monitoring and simulation applications.  The
                ChameLAN 100 may connect to the network at any
                location using standard equipment.  Standard graphical
                Motif/X-Windows and TCP/IP allow remote control
                through Ethernet and 10Base T interfaces.  Tekelec
                also offers a rackmounted model -- ChameLAN 100-X.
                Both models can be controlled via a Sun Workstation
                remotely.

        CAVEATS
                none.

        BUGS

          ABSTRACT
               The CMU SNMP Distribution includes source code for an
               SNMP agent, several SNMP client applications, an ASN.1
               library, and supporting documentation.

               The agent compiles into about 10 KB of 68000 code.  The
               distribution includes a full agent that runs on a
               Kinetics FastPath2/3/4, and is built into the KIP
               appletalk/ethernet gateway.  The machine independent
               portions of this agent also run on CMU's IBM PC/AT
               based router.

               The applications are designed to be useful in the real
               world.  Information is collected and presented in a
               useful format and is suitable for everyday status
               monitoring.  Input and output are interpreted
               symbolically.  The tools can be used without
               referencing the RFCs.

          NAME
               Computer Security Checklist

          KEYWORDS
               security; DOS.

          ABSTRACT
               This program consists of 858 computer security ques-
               tions divided up in thirteen sections.  The program
               presents the questions to the user and records their
               responses.  After answering the questions in one of the
               thirteen sections, the user can generate a report from
               the questions and the user's answers.  The thirteen
               sections are: telecommunications security, physical
               access security, personnel security, systems develop-
               ment security, security awareness and training prac-
               tices, organizational and management security, data and
               program security, processing and operations security,
               ergonomics and error prevention, environmental secu-
               rity, and backup and recovery security.

               The questions are weighted as to their importance, and
               the report generator can sort the questions by weight.
               This way the most important issues can be tackled
               first.

          MECHANISM
               The questions are displayed on the screen and the user
               is prompted for a single keystroke reply.  When the end
               of one of the thirteen sections is reached, the answers
               are written to a disk file.  The question file and the
               answer file are merged to create the report file.

          CAVEATS
               None.

          BUGS
               None known.

          LIMITATIONS

                CMIP Library

        KEYWORDS
                manager; osi; cmis; unix; free, sourcelib.

        ABSTRACT

                The CMIP Library implements the functionality of the
                Common  Management Information Service/Protocol as in
                the full international standards (ISO 9595, ISO 9596)
                published in 1990. It is designed to work with the
                ISODE package and can act as a building block for the
                construction of CMIP-based agent and manager
                applications.

        MECHANISM
                The CMIP library uses ISO ROS, ACSE and ASN.1
                presentation, as implemented in ISODE, to provide its
                service.

        CAVEATS
                None.

        BUGS
                None known.

          NAME
               decaddrs, decaroute, decnroute, xnsroutes, bridgetab

          KEYWORDS
               manager, map, routing; bridge, DECnet; NMS, SNMP; UNIX.

          ABSTRACT
               These commands display private MIB information from
               Wellfleet systems.  They retrieve and format for
               display values of one or several MIB variables from the
               Wellfleet Communications private enterprise MIB, using
               the SNMP (RFC1098).  In particular these tools are used
               to examine the non-IP modules (DECnet, XNS, and Bridg-
               ing) of a Wellfleet system.

               Decaddrs displays the DECnet configuration of a
               Wellfleet system acting as a DECnet router, showing the
               static parameters associated with each DECnet inter-
               face.  Decaroute and decnroute display the DECnet
               inter-area and intra-area routing tables (that is area
               routes and node routes).  Xnsroutes displays routes
               known to a Wellfleet system acting as an XNS router.
               Bridgetab displays the bridge forwarding table with the
               disposition of traffic arriving from or directed to
               each station known to the Wellfleet bridge module.  All
               these commands take an IP address as the argument and
               can specify an SNMP community for the retrieval.  One
               SNMP query is performed for each row of the table.
               Note that the Wellfleet system must be operating as an
               IP router for the SNMP to be accessible.

          MECHANISM
               Management information is exchanged by use of SNMP.

          CAVEATS
               None.

          BUGS
               None known.

          NAME
               DiG

          KEYWORDS
               status; DNS; spoof; UNIX; free.

          ABSTRACT
               DiG (domain information groper), is a command line tool
               which queries DNS servers in either an interactive or a
               batch mode.  It was developed to be more
               convenient/flexible than nslookup for gathering perfor-
               mance data and testing DNS servers.

          MECHANISM
               Dig is built on a slightly modified version of the bind
               resolver (release 4.8).

          CAVEATS
               none.

          BUGS
               None known.

          LIMITATIONS
               None reported.

          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               No restrictions.

          SOFTWARE REQUIRED
               BSD UNIX.

          AVAILABILITY
               DiG is available via anonymous FTP from venera.isi.edu
               in pub/dig.2.0.tar.Z.

        Internet Tool Catalog                  EMANATE_SNMP_RESEARCH

        NAME
                EMANATE: Enhanced MANagement Agent Through Extensions
                from SNMP Research.

        KEYWORDS
                alarm, control, manager, reference, security, status;
                bridge, Ethernet, FDDI, IP, OSI, ring, star;
                NMS, SNMP;
                sourcelib.

        ABSTRACT
                The EMANATE system provides a run-time extensible SNMP
                agent that dynamically reconfigures an agent's MIB
                without having to recompile, relink, or restart the
                agent.  An EMANATE capable SNMP agent can support zero,
                one, or many subagents and dynamically reconfigure to
                connect or disconnect those subagents' MIBs.

                The EMANATE system consists of several logically
                independent components and subsystems:

                o Master SNMP agent which contains an API to communicate
                  with subagents.
                o Subagents which implement various MIBS.
                o Subagent Developer's Kit which contains tools to assist
                  in the implementation of subagents.
                o EMANATE libraries which provide the API for the
                  subagent.

        MECHANISM
                A concise API allows a standard means of communication
                between the master and subagents.  System dependent
                mechanisms are employed for transfer of information
                between the master and subagents.

        CAVEATS

        BUGS

          Internet Tool Catalog                          ETHERFIND_SUN

          NAME
               etherfind

          KEYWORDS
               traffic; ethernet, IP, NFS; eavesdrop; UNIX.

          ABSTRACT
               Etherfind examines the packets that traverse a network
               interface, and outputs a text file describing the
               traffic.  In the file, a single line of text describes
               a single packet: it contains values such as protocol
               type, length, source, and destination.  Etherfind can
               print out all packet traffic on the ethernet, or
               traffic for the local host.  Further packet filtering
               can be done on the basis of protocol: IP, ARP, RARP,
               ICMP, UDP, ND, TCP, and filtering can also be done
               based on the source, destination addresses as well as
               TCP and UDP port numbers.

          MECHANISM
               In usual operations, and by default, etherfind puts the
               interface in promiscuous mode.  In 4.3BSD UNIX and
               related OSs, it uses a Network Interface Tap (NIT) to
               obtain a copy of traffic on an ethernet interface.

          CAVEATS
               None.

          BUGS
               None known.

          LIMITATIONS
               Minimal protocol information is printed.  Can  only  be
               run by the super user.  The syntax is painful.

          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               Ethernet.

          SOFTWARE REQUIRED
               SunOS.

          AVAILABILITY

               Programs" software installation option.

                ;

        ABSTRACT
                Mike Patton of MIT LCS has compiled a very
                comprehensive list of the IEEE numbers used on
                Ethernet and FDDI (with some permutation).
                This file contains collected information on the
                various codes used on IEEE 802.3 and EtherNet.
                There are three "pages": type codes, vendor
                codes, and the uses of multicast (including
                broadcast) addresses.

        MECHANISM
                FTP the file and use it like a secret decoder ring.

        CAVEATS
                Since this information is from collected wisdom,
                there are certainly omissions.

        BUGS
                Mike welcomes any further additions.

        Internet Tool Catalog                 GENERIC-MANAGED-SYSTEM

        NAME
                Generic Managed System

        KEYWORDS
                manager; osi; cmis; unix; free, sourcelib

        ABSTRACT
                The Generic Managed System (GMS) implements the
                functions that would be common to any OSI managed
                system. These include the parseing of CMIS requests,
                selection of managed objects according to the scoping
                and filtering rules, handling of notifications and
                event forwarding discriminators etc. The intention is
                that the implementors should use the GMS as a basis
                for their own managed object implementations. A
                support environment is provided to assist with this.

        MECHANISM
                The GMS uses the UCL CMIP library plus a library of
                C++ objects representing common managed objects and
                attribute types.

        CAVEATS
                The system is still experimental, is subject to change
                and is not yet well documented.

        BUGS
                See above.

        LIMITATIONS
                None known.

        HARDWARE REQUIRED
                Has been tested on SUN 3 and SUN 4 architectures.

        SOFTWARE REQUIRED
                The ISODE protocol suite, BSD UNIX, UCL CMIP Library,
                GNU C++ (g++).

        AVAILABILITY
                The CMIP library and related management tools built
                upon it, known as OSIMIS (OSI Management Information
                Service), are publicly available from University
                College London, England via FTP and FTAM.  To obtain

        Internet Tool Catalog                              GETETHERS

        NAME
                getethers

        KEYWORDS
                Traffic; Ethernet; Ping; UNIX; Free

        ABSTRACT
                Getethers runs through all addresses on an ethernet
                segment (a.b.c.1 to a.b.c.254) and pings each address,
                and then determines the ethernet address for that
                host.  It produces a list, in either plain ASCII, the
                file format for the Excelan Lanalyzer, or the file
                format for the Network General Sniffer, of
                hostname/ethernet address pairs for all hosts on the
                local nework.  The plain ASCII list optionally
                includes the vendor name of the ethernet card in
                each system, to aid in the determination of the
                identity of unknown systems.

        MECHANISM
                Getethers uses a raw IP socket to generate ICMP echo
                requests and receive ICMP echo replies, and then
                examines the kernel ARP table to determine the
                ethernet address of each responding system.

        CAVEATS
                Assumes that the ethernet it is looking at is either
                a Class C IP network, or part of a Class B IP network
                that is subnetted with a netmask of 255.255.255.0.
                (This is easy to change, but it's compiled in.)

        BUGS
                None known.

        LIMITATIONS
                None.

        HARDWARE REQUIRED
                Has been tested on Sun-3 and Sun-4 (SPARC) systems
                under SunOS 4.1.x, DEC VAXes under 4.3BSD.

        SOFTWARE REQUIRED
                Runs under SunOS 4.x and 4.3BSD; should be easy to
                port to any other Berkeley-like system.  Requires
                raw sockets and the ioctl calls to get at the ARP
                table.

          NAME
               getone, getmany, getroute, getarp, getaddr, getif,
               getid.

          KEYWORDS
               manager, routing, status; IP; NMS, SNMP; UNIX.

          ABSTRACT
               These commands retrieve and format for display values
               of one or several MIB variables (RFC1066) using the
               SNMP (RFC1098).  Getone and getmany retrieve arbitrary
               MIB variables; getroute, getarp, getaddr, and getif
               retrieve and display tabular information (routing
               tables, ARP table, interface configuration, etc.), and
               getid retrieves and displays system name, identifica-
               tion and boot time.

               Getone <target> <mibvariable> retrieves and displays
               the value of the designated MIB variable from the
               specified target system.  The SNMP community name to be
               used for the retrieval can also be specified.  Getmany
               works similarly for groups of MIB variables rather than
               individual values.  The name of each variable, its
               value and its data type is displayed.  Getroute returns
               information from the ipRoutingTable MIB structure,
               displaying the retrieved information in an accessible
               format.  Getarp behaves similarly for the address
               translation table; getaddr for the ipAddressTable; and
               getif displays information from the interfaces table,
               supplemented with information from the ipAddressTable.
               Getid displays the system name, identification, ipFor-
               warding state, and the boot time and date.  All take a
               system name or IP address as an argument and can
               specify an SNMP community for the retrieval.  One SNMP
               query is performed for each row of the table.

          MECHANISM
               Queries SNMP agent(s).

          KEYWORDS
               benchmark, generator; IP; DOS; free.

          ABSTRACT
               Hammer and Anvil are the benchmarking programs for IP
               routers.  Using these tools, gateways have been tested
               for per-packet delay, router-generated traffic over-
               head, maximum sustained throughput, etc.

          MECHANISM
               Tests are performed on a gateway in an isolated
               testbed.  Hammer generates packets at controlled rates.
               It can set the length and interpacket interval of a
               packet stream.  Anvil counts packet arrivals.

          CAVEATS
               Hammer should not be run on a live network.

          BUGS
               None reported.

          LIMITATIONS
               Early versions of hammer could not produce inter-packet
               intervals shorter than 55 usec.

          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               Hammer runs on a PC/AT or compatible, and anvil
               requires a PC or clone.  Both use a Micom Interlan
               NI5210 for LAN interface.

          SOFTWARE REQUIRED
               MS-DOS.

          AVAILABILITY
               Hammer and anvil are copyrighted, though free.  Copies
               are available from pub/eutil on husc6.harvard.edu.

          Internet Tool Catalog                               HOPCHECK

          NAME
               hopcheck

          KEYWORDS
               routing; IP; ping; DOS; free.

          ABSTRACT
               Hopcheck is a tool that lists the gateways traversed by
               packets sent from the hopcheck-resident PC to a desti-
               nation.  Hopcheck uses the same mechanism as traceroute
               but is for use on IBM PC compatibles that have ethernet
               connections.  Hopcheck is part of a larger TCP/IP pack-
               age that is known as ka9q that is for use with packet
               radio.  Ka9q can coexist on a PC with other TCP/IP
               packages such as FTP Inc's PC/TCP, but must be used
               independently of other packages.  Ka9q was written by
               Phil Karn.  Hopcheck was added by Katie Stevens,
               dkstevens@ucdavis.edu.  Unlike traceroute, which
               requires a UNIX kernel mod, hopcheck will run on the
               standard, unmodified ka9q release.

          MECHANISM
               See the description in traceroute.

          CAVEATS
               See the description in traceroute.

          BUGS
               None known.

          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               IBM PC compatible with ethernet network interface card;
               ethernet card supported through FTP spec packet driver.

          SOFTWARE REQUIRED
               DOS.

          AVAILABILITY
               Free for radio amateurs and educational institutions;
               others should contact Phil Karn, karn@ka9q.bellcore.com.

          Internet Tool Catalog                         INTERNET_ROVER

          NAME
               Internet Rover

          KEYWORDS
               status; IP, SMTP; curses, ping, spoof; UNIX; free,
               sourcelib.

          ABSTRACT
               Internet Rover is a prototype network monitor that uses
               multiple protocol "modules" to test network functional-
               ity.  This package consists of two primary pieces of
               code: the data collector and the problem display.

               There is one data collector that performs a series of
               network tests, and maintains a list of problems with
               the network.  There can be many display processes all
               displaying the current list of problems which is useful
               in a multi-operator NOC.

               The display task uses curses, allowing many terminal
               types to display the problem file either locally or
               from a remote site.  Full source is provided.  The data
               collector is easily configured and extensible.  Contri-
               butions such as additional protocol modules, and shell
               script extensions are welcome.

          MECHANISM
               A configuration file contains a list of nodes,
               addresses, NodeUp? protocol test (ping in most cases),
               and a list of further tests to be performed if the node
               is in fact up.  Modules are included to test TELNET,
               FTP, and SMTP.  If the configuration contains a test
               that isn't recognized, a generic test is assumed, and a
               filename is checked for existence.  This way users can
               create scripts that create a file if there is a prob-
               lem, and the data collector simply checks the existence
               of that file to determine if there is problem.

          CAVEATS
               None.

          BUGS
               None known.

          LIMITATIONS
               This tool does not yet have the capability to  perform
               actions based on the result of the test.  Rather, it is
               intended for a multi-operator environment,  and  simply
               displays a list of what is wrong with the net.

          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               This software is known to run on Suns and IBM RTs.

          SOFTWARE REQUIRED
               Curses, 4.xBSD UNIX socket programming  libraries,  BSD
               ping.

        Internet Tool Catalog                                 IOZONE

        NAME
                iozone

        KEYWORDS
                benchmark; nfs;; dos,hp,unix,vmx; free.

        ABSTRACT
                Software to assess the sequential file I/O capability
                of a system.  May be useful as reference to compare
                against results obtained when files are accessed via
                NFS, Andrew, etc.

        MECHANISM
                This test writes a X MEGABYTE sequential file in Y
                byte chunks, then rewinds it and reads it back.
                [The size of the file should be big enough to factor
                out the effect of any disk cache.].  Finally,
                IOZONE deletes the temporary file.  Options allow one to
                vary X and Y.  In addition, 'auto test' runs IOZONE
                repeatedly using record sizes from 512 to 8192 bytes
                (adjustable), and file sizes from 1 to 16 megabytes
                (adjustable).  It creates a table of results.

        CAVEATS
                The file is written (filling any cache buffers), and
                then read.  If the cache is >= X MB, then most if not
                all the reads will be satisfied from the cache.
                However, if it is less than or equal to
                .5X MB, then NONE of the reads will be satisfied from
                the cache.  This is becase after the file is written,
                a .5X MB cache will contain the upper .5 MB of the
                test file, but we will start reading
                from the beginning of the file (data which is no
                longer in the cache).

                In order for this to be a fair test, the length of the
                test file must be AT LEAST 2X the amount of disk cache
                memory for your system.  If not, you are really
                testing the speed at which your CPU
                can read blocks out of the cache (not a fair test).

        BUGS
                none known at this time.

        LIMITATIONS
                IOZONE does not normally test the raw I/O speed of
                your disk or system-em.  It tests the speed of
                sequential I/O to actual files.
                Therefore, this measurement factors in the efficiency
                of you  machines file system, operating system, C
                compiler, and C runtime library.  It produces a
                measurement which is the number of bytes
                per second that your system can read or write to a file.

        NAME
                LADDIS

        KEYWORDS
                benchmark, generator;
                NFS;
                spoof;
                unix;
                free.

        ABSTRACT

                "LADDIS: A Multi-Vendor and Vendor-Neutral SPEC NFS
                Benchmark", Bruce Nelson, LADDIS Group & Auspex Systems.

                Over the past 24 months, engineers from Legato,
                Auspex, Data General, DEC, Interphase, and Sun
                (LADDIS) met regularly to create the LADDIS NFS
                benchmark: an unbiased, standard, vendor-independent,
                scalable NFS performance test.

                The purpose of the LADDIS benchmark is to give users a
                credible and undisputed test of NFS performance, and
                to give vendors a publishable standard performance
                measure that customers can use for load planning,
                system configuration, and equipment buying decisions.
                Toward this end, the LADDIS benchmark is being adopted
                by SPEC (the System Performance Evaluation
                Cooperative, creators of SPECmarks) as the first
                member of SPEC's System-level File Server (SFS)
                benchmark suite."

                "In particular, we have had unexpected interest from
                some router vendors in using LADDIS to both rate and
                stress-test IP routers. This is because LADDIS can
                send back-to-back full-size packet trains, and because
                it can generate a 90%-Ethernet util on simulated
                "real" NFS workloads, just like routers encounter in
                the real world. But LADDIS is for local Ethernet or
                FDDI nets only, not WAN."

        MECHANISM
                Generates NFS requests and measures responsiveness of
                the server.

        CAVEATS
                "LADDIS is not released yet by SPEC, although a free
                beta version, quite stable, is available now as
                PRE-LADDIS. So you might want to put PRE-LADDIS in
                your listing, noting that full LADDIS
                availability from SPEC is expected by the end of 1992."

        BUGS
                The licensee is requested to direct beta test comments
                via electronicmail to:
                "spec-preladdis-comments@riscee.pko.dec.com".

                This alias will forward all comments to the SPECSFS
                mailing list (which includes the LADDIS Group).

        LIMITATIONS
                LADDIS is for local Ethernet or FDDI nets only, not
                WAN.

        HARDWAE REQUIRED
                A host with LAN connectivity.  Presumably, a host with
                enough horsepower to generate an adequate work load.

        SOFTWARE REQUIRED
                LADDIS is a sophisticated Unix-based NFS traffic
                generator program.

                From: bnelson (Bruce Nelson)

                Dear Person:

                The SPEC PRE-LADDIS beta test process became
                operational on Monday, February 3, 1992.  This email
                describes the process as announced during the LADDIS
                Group's presentation at UniForum '92 and
                also at Interop '91. The content of the beta test
                license and the license request process are consistent
                with the proposals approved by the SPEC Steering
                Committee at the January 1992 meeting in Milpitas,
                California.

                The SPEC PRE-LADDIS beta test will consist of one beta
                test version of PRE-LADDIS distributed ONLY by
                electronic mail. The SPEC PRE-LADDIS Beta test
                software is licensed by SPEC, not by the LADDIS
                Group.

          Internet Tool Catalog                             LAN_PATROL

          NAME
               LAN Patrol

          KEYWORDS
               security, traffic; ethernet, star; eavesdrop; DOS.

          ABSTRACT
               LAN Patrol is a full-featured network analyzer that
               provides essential information for effective fault and
               performance management.  It allows network managers to
               easily monitor user activity, find traffic overloads,
               plan for growth, test cable, uncover intruders, balance
               network services, and so on.  LAN Patrol uses state of
               the art data collection techniques to monitor all
               activity on a network, giving an accurate picture of
               how it is performing.

               LAN Patrol's reports can be saved as ASCII files to
               disk, and imported into spreadsheet or database pro-
               grams for further analysis.

          MECHANISM
               The LAN Patrol interface driver programs a standard
               interface card to capture all traffic on a network seg-
               ment.  The driver operates from the background of a
               standard PC, maintaining statistics for each station on
               the network.  The information can be viewed on the PC's
               screen, or as a user-defined report output either to
               file or printer.

          CAVEATS
               None.  Normal operation is completely passive, making
               LAN Patrol transparent to the network.

          BUGS
               None known.

          LIMITATIONS
               LAN Patrol can monitor up to 10,000 packets/sec on an
               AT class PC, and is limited to monitoring a maximum of
               1024 stations for intervals of up to 30 days.

               Because LAN Patrol operates at the physical level, it
               will only see traffic for the segment on which it is
               installed; it cannot see traffic across bridges.

        Internet Tool Catalog                               LANVista

        NAME
            LANVista

        KEYWORDS
            analyzer, benchmark, debugger, generator, manager, traffic;
            DECnet, Ethernet, IP, OSI, Ring; Eavesdrop, Proprietary;
            DOS, Standalone.

        ABSTRACT
            CXR/Digilog's LANVista family of protocol and statistical
            analyzers provide the tools to troubleshoot an Ethernet and
            Token Ring 4/16Mbps network.  LANVista lets you capture
            frames to RAM and or disk, generate traffic for stress
            testing, test your network cable for fault isolation, and
            decode all 7 layers of many popular protocol stacks.
            LANVista's 100 family offers exceptional price/performance
            and a wide range of options. Combined with an
            integrated upgrade path to the fully distributed LANVista
            200 system, the 100 line provides a  reasonably priced
            entry into LAN management and protocol analysis.

            All LANVista models are fully operable under Microsoft
            Windows. Under Windows, LANVista can be operated in
            the background, gathering data and alarms as other
            tasks are completed. Displayed data may easily be
            cut from LANVista and pasted into other Windows
            applications such as Excel, Lotus 1-2-3, Harvard
            Graphics, etc.

            The versatile LANVista family can also be remotely
            controlled through the use of PC Anywhere, Commute,
            Carbon Copy, or other PC remote control packages.
            This feature allows the use of "co-pilot" mode which
            enables an operator at the central site to guide and
            train a remote operator through network management or
            analysis tasks.

            All LANVista models provide features vital to effective
            network management and troubleshooting.  Basic
            capabilities include: Network database, statistics
            based on the entire network and on a node basis, Token
            Ring functional address statistics, Bridged  traffic
            statistics, Protocol statistics, logging of statistics
            to a printer or file of user definable alarms, Hardware
            Pre-Capture filtering, Post capture filtering, Playback of
            captured data, Traffic simulation and On-line context

            sensitive Help.

            Protocol Interpreters used for decoding network traffic
            supported by LANVista include: TCP/IP, DECnet, Banyan
            Vines, XNS/MS-Net, AppleTalk, IBM Token Ring, Novell,
            3Com 3+ Open, SNMP and OSI.

        MECHANISM
            LANVista is available in three forms.  A kit version which
            consists of a plug-in PC card and Master software, a self
            contained unit that packages the kit version in a portable
            PC, and a Distributed system.  The LANVista distributed
            system allows slave units placed anywhere in the world to
            be controlled from a single central location for
            centralized management of an enterprise network.
            LANVista's PC cards provides a physical interface to
            the LAN and frame preprocessing power.  The Master
            software controls the PC card, and the display and
            processing of information gathered from the network.

        CAVEATS
            Optimal performance of LANVista's master software is achieved
            with DOS 5.0 by utilizing RAMDRIVE.SYS, SMARTDRV.SYS and High
            memory.

        BUGS
            None Known.

        LIMITATIONS
            None Known.

        HARDWARE REQUIRED

          Internet Tool Catalog                               LANPROBE

          NAME
               LanProbe -- the HP 4990S LanProbe Distributed Analysis
               System.

          KEYWORDS
               alarm, manager, map, status, traffic; ethernet; eaves-
               drop, NMS; proprietary.

          ABSTRACT
               The LanProbe distributed monitoring system performs
               remote and local monitoring of ethernet LANs in a pro-
               tocol and vendor independent manner.

               LanProbe discovers each active node on a segment and
               displays it on a map with its adapter card vendor name,
               ethernet address, and IP address.  Additional informa-
               tion about the nodes, such as equipment type and physi-
               cal location can be entered in to the data base by the
               user.

               When the NodeLocator option is used, data on the actual
               location of nodes is automatically entered and the map
               becomes an accurate representation of the physical lay-
               out of the segment.  Thereafter when a new node is
               installed and becomes active, or when a node is moved
               or becomes inactive, the change is detected and shown
               on the map in real time.  The system also provides the
               network manager with precise cable fault information
               displayed on the map.

               Traffic statistics are gathered and displayed and can
               be exported in (comma delimited) CSV format for further
               analysis.  Alerts can be set on user defined thres-
               holds.

               Trace provides a remote protocol analyzer capability
               with decodes for common protocols.

               Significant events (like power failure, cable breaks,
               new node on network, broadcast IP source address seen,
               etc.) are tracked in a log that is uploaded to Pro-
               beView periodically.

               ProbeView generates reports that can be manipulated by
               MSDOS based word processors, spreadsheets, and DBMS.

RFC 1470          FYI: Network Management Tool Catalog         June 1993


          MECHANISM
               The system consists of one or more LanProbe segment
               monitors and ProbeView software running under Microsoft
               Windows.  The LanProbe segment monitor attaches to the
               end of an ethernet segment and monitors all traffic.
               Attachment can be direct to a thin or thick coax cable,
               or via an external transceiver to fiber optic or twist-
               ed pair cabling.  Network data relating to the segment
               is transferred to a workstation running ProbeView via
               RS-232, ethernet, or a modem connection.

               ProbeView software, which runs on a PC/AT class works-
               tation, presents network information in graphical
               displays.

               The HP4992A NodeLocator option attaches to the opposite
               end of the cable from the HP4991A LanProbe segment mon-
               itor.  It automatically locates the position of nodes
               on the ethernet networks using coaxial cabling schemes.

          Internet Tool Catalog                               LANWATCH

          NAME
               LANWatch

          KEYWORDS
               alarm, analyzer, traffic; CHAOS, DECnet, DNS, ethernet,
               IP, OSI, ring, SMTP, star; eavesdrop; DOS; library,
               sourcelib.

          ABSTRACT
               LANWatch 2.0 is an inexpensive, powerful and flexible
               network analyzer that runs under DOS on personal com-
               puters and requires no hardware modifications to either
               the host or the network.  LANWatch is an invaluable
               tool for installing, troubleshooting, and monitoring
               local area networks, and for developing and debugging
               new protocols.  Network managers using LANWatch can
               inspect network traffic patterns and packet errors to
               isolate performance problems and bottlenecks.  Protocol
               developers can use LANWatch to inspect and verify
               proper protocol handling.  Since LANWatch is a
               software-only package which installs easily in existing
               PCs, network technicians and field service engineers
               can carry LANWatch in their briefcase for convenient
               network analysis at remote sites.

               LANWatch has two operating modes: Display and Examine.
               In Display Mode, LANWatch traces network traffic by
               displaying captured packets in real time.  Examine Mode
               allows you to scroll back through stored packets to
               inspect them in detail.  To select a subset of packets
               for display, storage or retrieval, there is an exten-
               sive set of built-in filters.  Using filters, LANWatch
               collects only packets of interest, saving the user from
               having to sort through all network traffic to isolate
               specific packets.  The built-in filters include alarm,
               trigger, capture, load, save and search.  They can be
               controlled separately to match on source or destination
               address, protocol, or packet contents at the hardware
               and transport layers.  LANWatch also includes suffi-
               cient source code so users can modify the existing
               filters and parsers or add new ones.

               The LANWatch distribution includes executables and
               source for several post-processors: a TCP protocol
               analyzer, a node-by-node traffic analyzer and a dump
               file listing tool.

RFC 1470          FYI: Network Management Tool Catalog         June 1993


          MECHANISM
               Uses many common PC network interfaces by placing them
               in promiscuous mode and capturing traffic.

          CAVEATS
               Most PC network interfaces will not capture 100% of the
               traffic on a fully-loaded network (primarily missing
               back-to-back packets).

          BUGS
               None known.

          LIMITATIONS
               LANWatch can't analyze what it doesn't see (see
               Caveats).

          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               LANWatch requires a PC or PS/2 with a supported network
               interface card.

          SOFTWARE REQUIRED
               LANWatch runs in DOS.  Modification of the supplied
               source code or creation of additional filters and
               parsers requires Microsoft C 5.1

          Internet Tool Catalog                               LLL_ENTM

          NAME
               ENTM -- Ethernet Traffic Monitor

          KEYWORDS
               traffic; ethernet, IP; eavesdrop; VMS; free.

          ABSTRACT
               ENTM is a screen-oriented utility that runs under
               VAX/VMS.  It monitors local ethernet traffic and
               displays either a real time or cumulative, histogram
               showing a percent breakdown of traffic by ethernet pro-
               tocol type.  The information in the display can be
               reported based on packet count or byte count.  The per-
               cent of broadcast, multicast and approximate lost pack-
               ets is reported as well.  The screen display is updated
               every three seconds.  Additionally, a real time, slid-
               ing history window may be displayed showing ethernet
               traffic patterns for the last five minutes.

               ENTM can also report IP traffic statistics by packet
               count or byte count.  The IP histograms reflect infor-
               mation collected at the TCP and UDP port level, includ-
               ing ICMP type/code combinations.  Both the ethernet and
               IP histograms may be sorted by ASCII protocol/port name
               or by percent-value.  All screen displays can be saved
               in a file for printing later.

          MECHANISM
               This utility simply places the ethernet controller in
               promiscuous mode and monitors the local area network
               traffic.  It preallocates 10 receive buffers and
               attempts to keep 22 reads pending on the ethernet dev-
               ice.

          CAVEATS
               Placing the ethernet controller in promiscuous mode may
               severly slow down a VAX system.  Depending on the speed
               of the VAX system and the amount of traffic on the  lo-
               cal  ethernet,  a large amount of CPU time may be spent
               on the Interrupt Stack.  Running this code on any  pro-
               duction system during operational hours is discouraged.

          BUGS
               Due to a bug in the VAX/VMS ethernet/802 device driver,
               IEEE  802 format packets may not always be detected.  A
               simple test is performed to "guess" which  packets  are

               in  IEEE  802  format (DSAP equal to SSAP).  Thus, some
               DSAP/SSAP pairs may be reported as  an  ethernet  type,
               while  valid ethernet types may be reported as IEEE 802
               packets.

               In some hardware configurations, placing an ethernet
               controller in promiscuous mode with automatic-restart
               enabled will hang the controller.  Our VAX 8650 hangs
               running this code, while our uVAX IIs and uVAX IIIs do
               not.

          LIMITATIONS
               The user is required to have PHY_IO, TMPMBX and NETMBX
               privileges.  When activated, the program first checks
               that the user process as enough quotas remaining
               (BYTLM, BIOLM, ASTLM and PAGFLQUO) to successfully run
               the program without entering into an involuntary wait
               state.  Some quotas require a fairly generous setting.

               The contents of IEEE 802 packets are not examined.
               Only the presence of IEEE 802 packets on the wire is
               reported.

               The count of lost packets is approximated.  If, after
               each read completes on the ethernet device, the utility
               detects that it has no reads pending on that device,
               the lost packet counter is incremented by one.

               When the total number of bytes processed exceeds
               7fffffff hex, all counters are automatically reset to
               zero.

          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               A DEC ethernet controller.

          SOFTWARE REQUIRED
               VAX/VMS version V5.1+.

          Internet Tool Catalog                Interactive Network Map

          NAME
               map -- Interactive Network Map

          KEYWORDS
               manager, map; CHAOS, ethernet, IP, ring, star; NMS,
               ping, SNMP, X; UNIX; free, sourcelib.

          ABSTRACT
               Map draws a map of network connectivity and allows
               interactive examination of information about various
               components including whether hosts can be reached over
               the network.

               The program is supplied with complete source and is
               written in a modular fashion to make addition of dif-
               ferent protocols stacks, displays, or hardcopy devices
               relatively easy.  This is one of the reasons why the
               initial version supports at least two of each.  Contri-
               butions of additional drivers in any of these areas
               will be welcome as well as porting to additional plat-
               forms.

          MECHANISM
               Net components are pinged by use of ICMP echo and,
               optionally, CHAOS status requests and SNMP "gets."  The
               program initializes itself from static data stored in
               the file system and therefore does not need to access
               the network in order to get running (unless the static
               files are network mounted).

          CAVEATS
               As of publication, the tool is in beta release.

          BUGS
               Several minor nits, documented in distribution files.
               Bug discoveries should be reported by email to Bug-
               Map@LCS.MIT.Edu.

          LIMITATIONS
               See distribution file for an indepth discussion of sys-
               tem capabilities and potential.

          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               An X display is needed for interactive display of the

               tronix 4692 printer is required.

          SOFTWARE REQUIRED
               BSD UNIX or related OS.  IP/ICMP is required;
               CHAOS/STATUS and SNMP can be used but are optional.
               X-Windows is required for interactive display of the
               map.

          Internet Tool Catalog                               MCONNECT

          NAME
               mconnect

          KEYWORDS
               status; SMTP; spoof; UNIX.

          ABSTRACT
               Mconnect allows an interactive session with a remote
               mailer.  Mail delivery problems can be diagnosed by
               connecting to the remote mailer and issuing SMTP com-
               mands directly.

          MECHANISM
               Opens a TCP connection to remote SMTP on port 25.  Pro-
               vides local line buffering and editing, which is the
               distinction between mconnect and a TELNET to port 25.

          CAVEATS
               None.

          BUGS
               None known.

          LIMITATIONS
               Mconnect is not a large improvement over using a TELNET
               connection to port 25.

          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               No restrictions.

          SOFTWARE REQUIRED
               BSD UNIX or related OS.

          AVAILABILITY
               Available with 4.xBSD UNIX and related operating sys-
               tems.

        Internet Tool Catalog                             MIB-BROWSER

        NAME
                MIB Browser

        KEYWORDS
                manager; osi; cmis, x; unix; free, sourcelib.

        ABSTRACT
                The MIB Browser is an X Windows HCI tool that allows
                you to "browse" through the objects in a Management
                Information Base (MIB). The browser is generic in that
                it can connect to a CMIS agent without having any
                prior knowledge of the structure of the MIB in the
                agent.

        MECHANISM
                CMIP is used to transfer the values of attributes
                between the managed system and the browser.

        CAVEATS
                None.

        BUGS
                Unexpected termination of the agent can cause browser
                to crash (ISODE bug!).

        HARDWARE REQUIRED
                Unix workstation, has been tested on SUN 3 and SUN 4
                architectures.

        SOFTWARE REQUIRED
                The ISODE protocol suite, BSD UNIX, X Windows, GNU C++
                (g++), Interviews (2.6).

        AVAILABILITY
                The CMIP library and related management tools built
                upon it, known as OSIMIS (OSI Management Information

        NAME
               MONET -- the Hughes LAN Systems SNMP Network Management
               Center (formerly the Hughes LAN Systems 9100) software
               product runs on a Sun SPARCStation hardware platform.

        KEYWORDS
               control, graphics, network topology,manager, routing,
               status, traffic; bridge, configuration, performance,

               RDBMS, intelligent hub management, DECnet, ethernet,
               IP; NMS, SNMP; UNIX.

        ABSTRACT
               Monet provides the capability to manage and control
               SNMP-based networking products from any vendor including
               those from Hughes LAN Systems.

               A comprehensive relational database manages the data and
               ensures easy access and control of resources throughout
               the network.

               Monet provides multivendor management through its
               advanced Mib master MIB parser that allows the parsing
               of enterprise MIBs (ASN.1 format per RFC1212) directly
               into the RDBMS for use by Monet's applications.

               Major features include:

               Remote access with X:
                    Use of the X/Motif user-interface, enabling remote
                    access to the all applications.

               Database Management
                    Stores and retrieves the information required to
                    administer and configure the network.  It can be
                    used to:
                         - Store and recall configuration data for all
                           devices.
                         - Provide availability history for devices.
                         - Assign new internet addresses.
                         - Provide administrative information such as
                           physical location of devices, responsible
                           person, maintenance history, asset data,
                           hardware/software versions, etc.
                         - Full-function SQL interface.
                         - User-customizable RDBMS report generation.

                Graphics and Network Mapping
                     The Graphics module enables the user to view the
                     nodes in the network as "dynamic" icons in
                     heirarchical maps.  The network is represented by
                     these heirarchical maps.  Though there is a
                     library of device icons, cities and geographical
                     maps included, the user has access to a
                     graphics editor that allows customizing and the
                     creation of new icons and maps.
                    A Device's icon may be selected to:
                        - Register/deregister the device,
                        - Access the open alarms and acknowledge
                          faults for the selected device,
                        - Ping the device to determine accessibility,
                        - Draw graphs of any of the device's numeric
                          MIB objects, either the values as retrieved
                          in real-time or the history values
                          previously stored in the RDBMS by the
                          Performance Manager,
                        - Telnet to the device,
                        - Customize the graphical dynamics (color,
                          fill, rotation, etc.) of the device's icon
                          by associating them to the values of the
                          device's MIB objects.

               Configuration Management
                    - Retrieves configuration information from SNMP
                      devices.
                    - Stores device parameters in the RDBMS, with
                      common sets of parameters used for multiple
                      devices, or for multiple ports on a device,
                      stored only once in the RDBMS.
                    - Configures devices from the parameters stored in
                      the RDBMS, including those relating to TCP/IP,
                      DECnet and any other protocol/feature
                      configurable via SNMP.
                    - Polls devices to compare their current parameter

          Internet Tool Catalog                            NET_MONITOR

          NAME
               net_monitor

          KEYWORDS
               routing, status; DECnet, IP; curses, ping; UNIX, VMS;
               free, sourcelib.

          ABSTRACT
               Net_monitor uses ICMP echo (and DECnet reachability
               information on VAX/VMS) to monitor a network.  The mon-
               itoring is very simplistic, but has proved useful.  It
               periodically tests whether hosts are reachable and
               reports the results in a full-screen display.  It
               groups hosts together in common sets.  If all hosts in
               a set become unreachable, it makes a lot of racket with
               bells, since it assumes that this means that some com-
               mon piece of hardware that supports that set has
               failed.  The periodicity of the tests, hosts to test,
               and groupings of hosts are controlled with a single
               configuration file.

               The idea for this program came from the PC/IP monitor
               facility, but is an entirely different program with
               different functionality.

          MECHANISM
               Reachability is tested using ICMP echo facilities for
               TCP/IP hosts (and DECnet reachability information on
               VAX/VMS).  A DECnet node is considered reachable if it
               appears in the list of hosts in a "show network" com-
               mand issued on a routing node.

          CAVEATS
               This facility has been found to be most useful when run
               in a window on a workstation rather than on a terminal
               connected to a host.  It could be useful if ported to a
               PC (looks easy using FTP Software's programming
               libraries), but this has not been done.  Curses is very
               slow and cpu intensive on VMS, but the tool has been
               run in a window on a VAXstation 2000.  Just don't try
               to run it on a terminal connected to a 11/750.

          BUGS
               None known.

          LIMITATIONS
               This tool is not meant to be a replacement for a more
               comprehensive network management facility such as is
               provided with SNMP.

          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               A host with a network connection.

          SOFTWARE REQUIRED
               Curses, 4.xBSD UNIX socket programming libraries (lim-
               ited set) and some flavor of TCP/IP that supports ICMP
               echo request (ping).  It has been run on VAX/VMS run-
               ning WIN/TCP and several flavors of 4BSD UNIX (includ-
               ing SunOS 3.2, 4.0, and 4.3BSD).  It could be ported to
               any platform that provides a BSD-style programming li-
               brary with an ICMP echo request facility and curses.

               Netlabs CMOT Agent

          KEYWORDS
               manager, status; IP, OSI; NMS.

          ABSTRACT
               Netlabs' CMOT code debuted in Interop 89.  The CMOT
               code comes with an Extensible MIB, which allows users
               to add new MIB variables.  The code currently supports
               all the MIB variables in RFC 1095 via the data types in
               RFC 1065, as well as the emerging MIB-II, which is
               currently in experimental stage.  The CMOT has been
               benchmarked at 100 Management Operations per Second
               (MOPS) for a 1-MIPS machine.

          MECHANISM
               The Netlabs CMOT agent supports the control and moni-
               toring of network resources by use of CMOT message
               exchanges.

          Internet Tool Catalog                   NETLABS_DUAL_MANAGER

          NAME
               Dual Manager

          KEYWORDS
               alarm, control, manager, map, security, status; IP,
               OSI; NMS, SNMP, X; UNIX; library.

          ABSTRACT
               Netlabs' Dual Manager provides management of TCP/IP
               networks using both SNMP and CMOT protoocls.  Such
               management can be initiated either through the X-
               Windows user interface (both Motif and Openlook), or
               through OSI Network Management (CMIP) commands.  The
               Dual Manager provides for configuration, fault, secu-
               rity and performance management.  It provides extensive
               map management features, including scanned maps in the
               background.  It provides simple mechanisms to extend
               the MIB and assign specific lists of objects to
               specific network elements, thereby providing for the
               management of all vendors' specific MIB extensions.  It
               provides an optional relational DBMS for storing and
               retrieving MIB and alarm information.  Finally, the
               Dual Manager is an open platform, in that it provides
               several Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for
               users to extend the functionality of the Dual Manager.

               The Dual Manager is expected to work as a TCP/IP
               "branch manager" under DEC's EMA, AT&T's UNMA and other
               OSI-conformant enterprise management architectures.

          MECHANISM
               The Netlabs Dual Manager supports the control and moni-
               toring of network resources by use of both CMOT and
               SNMP message exchanges.

          ABSTRACT
               Netlabs' SNMP code debuted in Interop 89, where it
               showed interoperation of the code with several imple-
               mentations on the show floor.  The SNMP code comes with
               an Extensible MIB, which allows users to add new MIB
               variables.  The code currently supports all the MIB
               variables in RFC 1066 via the data types in RFC 1065,
               as well as the emerging MIB-II, which is currently in
               experimental stage.  The SNMP has been benchmarked at
               200 Management Operations per Second (MOPS) for a 1-

        Internet Tool Catalog                 NetMetrix-Load-Monitor

        NAME
                NetMetrix Load Monitor

        KEYWORDS
                alarm,traffic; Ethernet, FDDI, IP, Ring; Eavesdrop,
                SNMP, X; UNIX;

        ABSTRACT
                The NetMetrix Load Monitor is a distributed
                client-server monitoring tool for ethernet, token
                ring, and FDDI networks.  A unique "dual" architecture
                provides compatibility with both RMON and X windows.
                RMON allows interoperability and an enterprise-wide
                view, while X windows enables much more powerful,
                intelligent applications at remote segments and saves
                network bandwidth.

                The Load Monitor provides extensive traffic
                statistics.  It looks at load by time interval, source
                node, destination node, application, protocol or
                packet size. A powerful ZOOM feature allows extensive
                correlational analysis which is displayed in a wide
                variety of graphs and tables.

                You can answer questions such as: Which sources are
                generating most of the load on the network when it is
                most heavily loaded and where is this load going?
                Which source/destination pairs generate the most
                traffic over the day?  Where should bridges and
                routers be located to optimally partition the network?
                How much load do applications, like the X Windows
                protocol, put on the network and who is generating that
                load when it is the greatest.

                A floating license allows easy access to the software
                tool anywhere you need it.

        MECHANISM
                NetMetrix turns the network interface into promiscuous
                mode to capture packets.

        CAVEATS
                none.

        BUGS
                none known.

        NAME
              NetMetrix NFS Monitor

        KEYWORDS
              traffic; Ethernet, FDDI, NFS, Ring; Eavesdrop, SNMP, X;
              UNIX

        ABSTRACT
                The NetMetrix NFS Monitor is a distributed network
                monitoring tool which monitors and graphs NFS load,
                response time, retransmits, rejects and errors by
                server, client, NFS procedure, or time
                interval.  Breakdown server activity by file system
                and client activity by user.

                A powerful ZOOM feature lets you correlate monitoring
                variables.  You can see client/server relationships,
                compare server performance, evaluate NFS performance
                enhancement strategies.

                A floating license and the X Window protocol allows
                monitoring of remote ethernet, token ring and FDDI
                segments from a central enterprise-wide display.

        MECHANISM
                NetMetrix turns the network interface into promiscuous
                mode to capture packets.

        Internet Tool Catalog            NetMetrix-Protocol-Analyzer

        NAME
              NetMetrix Protocol Analyzer

        KEYWORDS
                alarm, analyzer, traffic; DECnet, DNS, Ethernet, FDDI,
                IP, OSI, NFS, Ring, SMTP; Eavesdrop, SNMP, X; UNIX;
                Library

        ABSTRACT
                The NetMetrix Protocol Analyzer is a distributed
                client-server monitoring tool for ethernet, token
                ring, and FDDI networks.  A unique "dual" architecture
                provides compatibility with both RMON and
                X windows.  RMON allows interoperability, while X
                windows enables much more powerful, intelligent
                applications at remote segments and saves network
                bandwidth.

                With the Protocol Analyzer, you can decode and display
                packets as they are being captured. Extensive filters
                let you sift through packets either before or after
                trace capture.  The capture filter may be specified by
                source, destination between hosts, protocol, packet
                size, pattern match, or by a complete expression using
                an extensive filter expression language.

                Full 7-layer packet decodes are available for all
                major protocols including DECnet, Appletalk, Novell,
                XNS, SNA, BANYAN, OSI and TCP/IP.  The decodes for the
                TCP/IP stack have all major protocols including NFS,
                YP, DNS, SNMP, OSPF, etc.

                Request and reply packets are matched. Packets can be
                displayed in summary, detail or hex, with multiple
                views to see packet dialogues side by side.

                A complete developers' kit is available for custom
                decodes.

                A floating license allows easy acess to the software
                tool anywhere you need it.

        MECHANISM
                NetMetrix turns the network interface into promiscuous
                mode to capture packets.

        ABSTRACT
                The NetMetrix Traffic Generator is a distributed
                software tool which allows you to simulate network
                load or test packet dialogues between nodes on your
                ethernet, token ring, or FDDI segments.  The Traffic
                Generator can also be used to test and validate
                management station alarms, routers, bridges, hubs, etc.

                An easy-to-use programming interface provides complete
                flexibility over variables such as bandwidth, packet
                sequence, and conditional responses.

                A floating license and the X Window System protocol
                allows testing of remote ethernet, token ring and FDDI
                segments from a central console.

          Internet Tool Catalog                           NETMON_MITRE

          NAME
               NETMON and iptrace

          KEYWORDS
               traffic; IP; eavesdrop; UNIX; free.

          ABSTRACT
               NETMON is a facility to enable communication of net-
               working events from the BSD UNIX operating system to a
               user-level network monitoring or management program.
               Iptrace is a program interfacing to NETMON which logs
               TCP-IP traffic for performance measurement and gateway
               monitoring. It is easy to build other NETMON-based
               tools using iptrace as a model.

               NETMON resides in the 4.3BSD UNIX kernel.  It is
               independent of hardware-specific code in UNIX.  It is
               transparent to protocol and network type, having no
               internal assumptions about the network protocols being
               recorded.  It is installed in BSD-like kernels by
               adding a standard function call (probe) to a few points
               in the input and output routines of the protocols to be
               logged.

               NETMON is analogous to Sun Microsystems' NIT, but the
               interface tap function is extended by recording more
               context information.  Aside from the timestamp, the
               choice of information recorded is up to the installer
               of the probes.  The NETMON probes added to the BSD IP
               code supplied with the distribution include as context:
               input and output queue lengths, identification of the
               network interface, and event codes labeling packet dis-
               cards.  (The NETMON distribution is geared towards
               measuring the performance of BSD networking protocols
               in an IP gateway).

               NETMON is designed so that it can reside within the
               monitored system with minimal interference to the net-
               work processing.  The estimated and measured overhead
               is around five percent of packet processing.

               The user-level tool "iptrace" is provided with NETMON.
               This program logs IP traffic, either at IP-level only,
               or as it passes through the network interface drivers
               as well.  As a separate function, iptrace produces a
               host traffic matrix output.  Its third type of output

               is abbreviated sampling, in which only a pre-set number
               of packets from each new host pair is logged.  The
               three output types are configured dynamically, in any
               combination.

               OSITRACE, another logging tool with a NETMON interface,
               is available separately (and documented in a separate
               entry in this catalog).

          MECHANISM
               Access to the information logged by NETMON is through a
               UNIX special file, /dev/netmon.  User reads are blocked
               until the buffer reaches a configurable level of full-
               ness.

               Several other parameters of NETMON can be tuned at com-
               pile time.  A diagnostic program, netmonstat, is
               included in the distribution.

          CAVEATS
               None.

        Internet Tool Catalog           NETMON_WINDOWS_SNMP_RESEARCH

        NAME
                NETMON for Windows -- an SNMP-based network management
                tool that runs under Microsoft Windows 3.0 from SNMP
                Research.

        KEYWORDS
                alarm, control, manager, map, routing;
                DECnet, Ethernet, IP, OSI, ring, star;
                NMS, SNMP;
                DOS;
                sourcelib.

        ABSTRACT
                The NETMON application implements a powerful network
                management station based on a low-cost DOS platform.
                NETMON's network management tools for configuration,
                performance, security, and fault management have been
                used successfully with a wide assortment of wide- and
                local-area-network topologies and medias.  Multiprotocol
                devices are supported including those using TCP/IP,
                DECnet, and OSI protocols.

        Some features of NETMON's network management tools include:

                o Fault management tool displays a map of the network
                  configuration with node and link state indicated
                  in one of several colors to indicate current status;
                o Configuration management tool may be used to edit the
                  network management information base stored in the
                  NMS to reflect changes occurring in the network;
                o Graphs and tabular tools for use in fault and performance
                  management;
                o Mechanisms by which additional variables, such as vendor-
                  specific variables, may be added;
                o Alarms may be enabled to alert the operator of events
                  occurring in the network;
                o Events are logged to disk;
                o Output data may be transferred via flat files for
                  additional report generation by a variety of
                  statistical packages.

        The NETMON application comes complete with source code
        including a powerful set of portable libraries for generating
        and parsing SNMP messages.

        MECHANISM
                The NETMON for Windows application is based on the
                Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  Polling is
                performed via the powerful SNMP get-next operator and
                the SNMP get operator.  Trap directed polling is used
                to regulate the focus and intensity of the polling.

        Internet Tool Catalog                               NETscout

        NAME
                NETscout(tm)

        KEYWORDS
                Alarm, Analyzer, Manager, Status, Traffic;
                DECnet, Ethernet, IP, OSI, NFS, Ring, Star, Eavesdrop;

                UNIX;

        ABSTRACT
                The NETscout family of distributed LAN Analyzer
                devices are intended to provide network users with a
                comprehensive capability to identify and isolate fault
                conditions in data communications networks.
                NETscout has the capability to collect wide ranging
                statistical data, to display selectively captured and
                fully decoded network traffic, to set user-defined
                alarm conditions, and to obtain real-time updates
                from all segments of a widely dispersed internetwork
                from a centralized SNMP-compatible network management
                console.

                The NETscout family is based on standards so that
                operation may be realized in heterogeneous networks
                which constitute a multi-protocol, multi-topology,
                multi-vendor environment.  The fundamental standards
                upon which NETscout is based are the Simple Network
                Management Protocol (SNMP), which defines the protocol
                for all inter-communications between NETscout devices,
                and the Remote Monitoring Management Information Base
                (RMON-MIB), which defines the type of information
                which is to be gathered and made available to the
                user for each network segment.

                NETscout clients provide a full array of monitoring
                and analysis features including intelligent seven
                level decoding of all majorprotocol stacks:

                DOD including TCP/IP    XNS       Novell
                DECNET including LAT    ISO       APPLETALK
                IBM Token Ring          Vines     NETBIOS/SMB
                SNMP including RMON-MIB SUN-NFS   SMT

                NETscout agents support all nine groups of the
                RMON-MIB standard.  NETscout agents can work with any
                SNMP-based network management system and currently

                support Ethernet and Token Ring.

        MECHANISM
                The operation of the NETscout family is divided into
                two distinct subcategories.  The first is the "Client"
                which is the user console from which operational
                commands are issued and where all results and
                diagnostic information are displayed. In a NETscout
                topology it is feasible to have multiple clients
                active simultaneously within a single network.  The
                second category is the "Agent", a hardware/software
                device which is attached to a specific network
                segment and which gathers statistical information for
                that segment as well as providing a window into that
                segment where network traffic may be observed and
                gathered for more detailed user analysis.  A
                typical network will have multiple segments and
                multiple agents up to the point of having one agent
                for each logical network segment.

                NETscout Model 9210 is a software package which, when
                combined in a Sun SPARCstation in conjunction with
                SunNet Manager running under Open Windows, implements
                the NETscout client function.  SunNet Manager provides
                the background operational tools for client operation
                while the NETscout software provides
                application-specific functions related to RMON-MIB
                support as well as all software necessary to
                perform the protocol decode function.
                SunNet Manager also implements a network map file
                which includes a topographical display of the entire
                network and is the mechanism for selecting
                network elements to perform operations.

                NETscout Model 9215 is a software package that
                operates in conjunction with SunNet Manager and
                implements the statistics monitoring function only.
                That is, it does not include the protocol
                decode function or the mechanism to retrieve actual
                data from a remote agent.  It does, however, include
                complete statistics gathering and event and alarm
                generation.

                Frontier NETscout Models 9510 and 9515, and Model 9610
                and 9615 are agent software packages that implement
                selected network diagnostic functions when loaded into
                a Sun SPARCstation (9510, 9515) or a SynOptics
                LattisNet Hub (9610, 9615) respectively which is

                connected to an Ethernet network segment
                using conventional network interface hardware.  Models
                9510 and 9610 support all nine RMON-MIB groups
                including "filters" and "packet capture" and thus
                provide for complete protocol monitoring and decode
                when used with a client
                equipped with protocol decode software.  Models 9515
                an 9615 include support for seven RMON-MIB groups
                which excludes "filters" and "data capture" and
                therefore perform network monitoring only through
                collection and presentation of network statistics,
                events, and alarms.  All models also support the MIB2
                system and interface groups.

                Frontier NETscout Models 9520 and 9525, and Model 9620
                and 9625 are agent software packages that are
                identical in function to their respective models
                described above except that they are for use on
                Token Ring segments.

        CAVEATS
                The RMON-MIB standard for Token Ring applications has
                not yet beenformally released and is not approved.
                NETscout products correspond to the latest draft for
                Token Ring functions and will be updated as
                required to conform to the standard as it is approved.

        BUGS
                None known.

        LIMITATIONS
                None reported.

        HARDWARE REQUIRED
                Sun SPARCstation or LattisNet Hub depending upon Model
                number.

        SOFTWARE REQUIRED
                Sun OS 4.1.1 for client and agent, SunNet Manager for
                client.

          Internet Tool Catalog                                NETSTAT

          NAME
               netstat

          KEYWORDS
               routing; IP; UNIX, VMS; free.

          ABSTRACT
               Netstat is a program that accesses network related data
               structures within the kernel, then provides an ASCII
               format at the terminal.  Netstat can provide reports on
               the routing table, TCP connections, TCP and UDP
               "listens", and protocol memory management.

          MECHANISM
               Netstat accesses operating system memory to read the
               kernel routing tables.

          CAVEATS
               Kernel data structures can change while netstat is run-
               ning.

          BUGS
               None known.

          LIMITATIONS
               None reported.

          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               No restrictions.

          SOFTWARE REQUIRED
               BSD UNIX or related OS, or VMS.

          AVAILABILITY
               Available via anonymous FTP from uunet.uu.net, in
               directory bsd-sources/src/ucb.  Available with 4.xBSD

          Internet Tool Catalog                     NETWORK_INTEGRATOR

          NAME
               Network Integrator I

          KEYWORDS
               map, traffic; ethernet; UNIX.

          ABSTRACT
               This tool monitors traffic on network segments.  All
               information is dumped to either a log file or, for
               real-time viewing, to a command tool window.  Data is
               time-stamped according to date and time.  Logging can
               continue for up to 24 hours.

               The tool is flexible in data collection and presenta-
               tion.  Traffic filters can be specified according to
               header values of numerous protocols, including those
               used by Apple, DEC, Sun, HP, and Apollo.  Bandwidth
               utilization can be monitored, as well as actual load
               and peak throughput.  Additionally, the Network
               Integrator can analyze a network's topology, and record
               the location of all operational nodes on a network.

               Data can be displayed in six separate formats of bar
               graphs.  In addition, there are several routines for
               producing statistical summaries of the data collected.

          MECHANISM
               The tools work through RPC and XDR calls.

          CAVEATS
               Although the tool adds only little traffic to a net-
               work, generation of statistics from captured files
               requires a significant portion of a workstation's CPU.

          BUGS
               None known.

          LIMITATIONS
               Must be root to run monitor.  There does not seem to be
               a limit to the number of nodes, since it monitors by
               segments.  The only major limitation is the amount of
               disk space that a user can commit to the log files.
               The size of the log files, however, can be controlled
               through the tool's parameters.

        Internet Tool Catalog                               NFSwatch

        NAME
                nfswatch

        KEYWORDS
                Traffic; Ethernet, IP, NFS; Curses, Eavesdrop; UNIX;
                Free

        ABSTRACT
                Nfswatch monitors all incoming ethernet traffic to an
                NFS file server and divides it into several
                categories.  The number and percentage of packets
                received in each category is displayed on
                the screen in a continuously updated display.

                By default, nfswatch monitors all packets destined for
                the local host over a single network interface.
                Options are provided to specify the specific interface
                to be monitored, or all interfaces at once.  NFS
                traffic to the local host, to a remote host, from a
                specific host, between two hosts, or all NFS traffic
                on the network may be monitored.

                Categories of packets monitored and counted include:
                ND Read, ND Write, NFS Read, NFS Write, NFS Mount,
                Yellow Pages (NIS), RPC Authorization, Other RPC, TCP,
                UDP, ICMP, RIP, ARP, RARP, Ethernet Broadcast, and
                Other.

                Packets are also tallied either by file system or file
                (specific files may be watched as an option), NFS
                procedure name (RPC call), or NFS client hostname.

                Facilities for taking "snapshots" of the screen, as
                well as saving data to a log file for later analysis
                (the analysis tool is included) are also available.

        MECHANISM
                Nfswatch uses the Network Interface Tap, nit(4) under
                SunOS 4.x, and the Packet Filter, packetfilter(4),
                under Ultrix 4.x, to place the ethernet interface into
                promiscuous mode.  It filters out NFS packets, and
                decodes the file handles in order to determine how to
                count the packet.

RFC 1470          FYI: Network Management Tool Catalog         June 1993


        CAVEATS
                Because the NFS file handle is a non-standard (server
                private) piece of data, nfswatch must be modified to
                understand file handles used by various
                implementations.  It currently knows
                about the SunOS 4.x and Ultrix file handle formats.

        BUGS
                Does not monitor FDDI interfaces.  (It should be a
                simple change, but neither author has access to a
                system with FDDI interfaces for testing.)

        LIMITATIONS
                Up to 256 exported file systems and 256 individual
                files can be monitored at any time.

                Only NFS requests are counted; the NFS traffic
                generated by a server in response to those packets
                is not counted.

        HARDWARE REQUIRED
                Any Ultrix system (VAX or DEC RISC hardware)

        SOFTWARE REQUIRED
                Ultrix release 4.0 or later.  For Ultrix 4.1, may
                require the patched "if_ln.o" kernel module, available
                from Digital's Customer Support Center.

          Internet Tool Catalog                              NHFSSTONE

          NAME
               nhfsstone

          KEYWORDS
               benchmark, generator; NFS; spoof; UNIX; free.

          ABSTRACT
               Nhfsstone (pronounced n-f-s-stone, the "h" is silent)
               is an NFS benchmarking program.  It is used on an NFS
               client to generate an artificial load with a particular
               mix of NFS operations.  It reports the average response
               time of the server in milliseconds per call and the
               load in calls per second.  The nhfsstone distribution
               includes a script, "nhfsnums" that converts test
               results into plot(5) format so that they can be graphed
               using graph(1) and other tools.

          MECHANISM
               Nhfsstone is an NFS traffic generator.  It adjusts its
               calling patterns based on the client's kernel NFS
               statistics and the elapsed time.  Load can be generated
               over a given time or number of NFS calls.

          CAVEATS
               Nhfsstone will compete for system resources with other
               applications.

          BUGS
               None known.

          LIMITATIONS
               None reported.

          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               No restrictions.

          Internet Tool Catalog                                 NNSTAT

          NAME
               NNStat

          KEYWORDS
               manager, status, traffic; ethernet, IP; eavesdrop, NMS;
               UNIX; free.

          ABSTRACT
               NNStat is a collection of programs that provides an
               internet statistic collecting capability.  The NNStat
               strategy for statistic collection is to collect traffic
               statistics via a promiscuous ethernet tap on the local
               networks, versus instrumenting the gateways.  If all
               traffic entering or leaving a network or set of net-
               works traverses a local ethernet, then by stationing a
               statistic gathering agent on each local network a pro-
               file of network traffic can be gathered.  Statistical
               data is retrieved from the local agents by a global
               manager.

               A program called "statspy" performs the data gathering
               function.  Essentially, statspy reads all packets on an
               ethernet interface and records all information of
               interest.  Information of interest is gathered by exa-
               mining each packet and determining if the source or
               destination IP address is one that is being monitored,
               typically a gateway address.  If so then the contents
               of the packet are examined to see if they match further
               criteria.

               A program called "collect" performs global data collec-
               tion.  It periodically polls various statspy processes
               in the domain of interest to retrieve locally logged
               statistical data.

               The NNSTAT distribution comes with several sample awk
               programs which process the logged output of the collect
               program.

          MECHANISM
               Local agents (statspy processes) collect raw traffic
               data via a promiscuous ethernet tap.  Statistical, fil-
               tered or otherwise reduced data is retrieved from the
               local agents by a global manager (the "collect" pro-
               cess).

          Internet Tool Catalog                               NOCOL(8)

          NAME
               nocol - network monitoring tools for an IP network

          SYNOPSIS
               This is an overview of the NOCOL software.

          DESCRIPTION
               NOCOL (Network Operations Center On-Line) is a
               collection of network monitoring programs that run on
               Unix systems.  The software consists of a number of
               monitoring agents that poll various parameters from any
               system and put it in a format suitable for
               post-processing. The post-processors can be a display
               agent, an automated troubleshooting program, an
               event logging program, etc.  Presently, monitors for
               tracking reachability, SNMP traps, data throughput
               rate, and nameservers have been developed and are in
               use.  Addition of more monitoring agents is easy and
               they will be added as necessary.  A display agent-
               nocol(1) using curses has already been developed. Work
               on an "intelligent" module is currently in progress for
               event logging and some automatic troubleshooting.

               All data collected by the monitoring agents follows a
               fixed (non-readable) format. Each data entry is termed
               an event in NOCOL, and each event has certain flags and
               severity associated with it. The display agent
               nocol(1), displays the output of these monitoring
               agents depending on the severity of the event. There
               can be multiple displays running simultanously and
               all process the same set of monitored data.

               There are four levels of severity associated with an
               event- CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING and INFO. The severity
               level is controlled independently by the monitoring
               agents, and the decision to raise or set an event's
               severity to any level depends on the logic imbedded in
               the monitoring agent.

               As an example, for the pingmon(8) monitor, if a site is
               unreachable via ping, it would be assigned a severity
               of WARNING by pingmon, which would then elevate to
               CRITICAL if the site is still unreachable after some
               time. In the case of trapmon(8), an SNMP trap message
               of EGP neighbor lost would be directly assigned a
               severity level of CRITICAL, while an Warm Start trap is



NOCTools2 Working Group                                       [Page 116]

RFC 1470          FYI: Network Management Tool Catalog         June 1993


               assigned a severity of WARNING.

               The display agent (and other data post-processors)
               would use this event severity to decide whether to
               display it (or troubleshoot/log it) depending on the
               user selected display severity level.

               The software is very flexible and allows enhancements
               and development with a minimum amount of effort. The
               display module processes all the files present in the
               data directory, and displays them sequentially. This
               allows new monitoring programs to simply start
               generating data in the data directory and the display
               module will automatically start displaying the new
               data. The monitoring tools can be changed, and the only
               element that has to remain common between all the
               modules is the EVENT data structure.

          CURRENT MODULES
               NOCOL presently consists of the following modules:

          nocol
               which simply displays the data collected by the
               monitoring agents.  It uses the curses screen
               management system to support a wide variety of terminal
               types. The criterion for displaying an event is:

               1. Severity level of the event is higher than the
                  severity level set in the display.

               2. The display filter (if set) matches some string in
                  the event line.

               The display can be in regular 80 column mode or in
               extended 132 column mode.  Critical events are
               displayed in reverse video (if the terminal type
               supports it). Additional features like displaying
               informational messages in a part of the window,
               automatic resizing window sizes, operator
               acknowledgement via a bell when a new event goes
               critical are also available.

          ippingmon
               which monitors the reachability of a site via "ICMP"
               ping packets (ICMP was preferred over SNMP for many
               obvious reasons). This program can use the default out-
               put from the system's ping program, but an accompanying
               program ( multiping) can ping multiple IP sites at the



NOCTools2 Working Group                                       [Page 117]

RFC 1470          FYI: Network Management Tool Catalog         June 1993


               same time and is preferable for monitoring a large list
               of sites.  A site is marked unreachable if a certain
               number of packets is lost, and the severity level is
               increased each time that the site tests unreachable.

          osipingmon
               which is similar to the ippingmon module but uses the
               OSI ping program instead. No multiple ping program for
               OSI sites has been developed at this time.  The only
               requirement is that the system's ping program output
               match the typical BSD IP ping program's output.

          nsmon
               which monitors the nameservers (named) on the list of
               specified hosts. It periodically sends an SOA query for
               the default domain and if the queried nameservers
               cannot resolve the query, then the site is elevated to
               CRITICAL status.

          tpmon
               For monitoring the throughput (kbits per second) to a
               list of hosts.  The program connects to the discard
               socket on the remote machine (using  a  STREAM  socket)
               and sends large packets for a small amount of time to
               evaluate the effective throughput. It elevates a site
               to WARNING level if the throughput drops below a
               certain threshold (set in the configuration file).

          trapmon
               Converts all SNMP traps into a format suitable for
               displaying using NOCOL.  The severity of the various
               traps is preset (and can be changed during compilation
               time).


     PLATFORM
          Any Unix system with the curses screen management library
          and IP (Internet Protocol) programming facility. It has been
          tested on Sun Sparc 4.1.1, Ultrix, and NeXT systems. Porting
          to other platforms might require minor adjustments depending
          on the vagaries of the different vendors (mostly in the
          include files).

     AVAILABILITY
          NOCOL was developed at JvNCnet and has been in use for
          monitoring the JvNCnet wide area network since 1989.
          It is available via anonymous FTP from ftp.jvnc.net under
          pub/jvncnet-packages/nocol.tar.Z.  The system running at

          JvNCet can be viewed by logging into the host nocol.jvnc.net
          with username nocol (an rlogin instead of telnet will handle
          your X window terminal types better).

     FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

          Possible future enhancements are:

          1. Event logging.

          2. Addition of an automated  troubleshooting  mechanism
             when  a  site  severity  level  reaches a particular
             level.

          3. SNMP monitors to watch the state  of  certain  vari-
             ables  (interface  errors,  packet rate, route state
             changes).

          Internet Tool Catalog                                   NPRV

          NAME
               NPRV -- IP Node/Protocol Reachability Verifier

          KEYWORDS
               map, routing, status; IP; ping; VMS; free.

          ABSTRACT
               NPRV is a full-screen, keypad-oriented utility that
               runs under VAX/VMS.  It allows the user to quickly scan
               through a user-defined list of IP addresses (or domain
               names) and verify a node's reachability.  The node's
               reachability is determined by performing an ICMP echo,
               UDP echo and a TCP echo at alternating three second
               intervals.  The total number of packets sent and
               received are displayed, as well as the minimum, average
               and maximum round-trip times (in milliseconds) for each
               type of echo.  Additionally, a "trace route" function
               is performed to determine the path from the local sys-
               tem to the remote host.  Once all of the trace route
               information has filled the screen, a "snapshot" of the
               screen can be written to a text file.  Upon exiting the
               utility, these text files can be used to generate a
               logical network map showing host and gateway intercon-
               nectivity.

          MECHANISM
               The ICMP echo is performed by sending ICMP ECHO REQUEST
               packets.  The UDP and TCP echoes are performed by con-
               necting to the UDP/TCP echo ports (port number 7).  The
               trace route information is compiled by sending alter-
               nating ICMP ECHO REQUEST packets and UDP packets with
               very large destination UDP port numbers (in two
               passes).  Each packet is initially sent with a TTL
               (time to live) of 1.  This should cause an ICMP TIME
               EXCEEDED error to be generated by the first routing
               gateway.  Then each packet is sent with a TTL of 2.
               This should cause an ICMP TIME EXCEEDED error to be
               generated by the second routing gateway.  Then each
               packet is sent with a TTL of 3, and so on.  This pro-
               cess continues until an ICMP ECHO REPLY or UDP PORT
               UNREACHABLE is received.  This indicates that the
               remote host has been reached and that the trace route
               information is complete.

          CAVEATS
               This utility sends one echo packet per second (ICMP,
               UDP or TCP), as well as sending out one trace route
               packet per second.  If a transmitted trace route packet
               is returned in less than one second, another trace
               route packet is sent in 100 milliseconds.  This could
               cause a significant amount of contention on the local
               network.

          LIMITATIONS
               The user is required to have SYSPRV privilege to per-
               form the ICMP Echo and trace route functions.  The
               utility will still run with this privilege disabled,
               but only the UDP Echo and TCP Echo information will be
               displayed.  This utility is written in C, but unfor-
               tunately it cannot be easily ported over to UNIX since
               many VMS system calls are used and all screen I/O is
               done using the VMS Screen Management Routines.

        Internet Tool Catalog                               NSLOOKUP

        NAME
                nslookup

        KEYWORDS
                status; DNS, BIND; UNIX, VMS; free.

        ABSTRACT
                Nslookup is an interactive program for querying
                Internet Domain Name System (DNS) servers.  It is
                essentially a user-friendly front end to
                the BIND "resolver" library routines.

                This program is useful for converting a hostname
                into an IP address (and vice versa), determining
                the name servers for a domain , listing
                the contents of a domain, displaying any type of
                DNS record, such as MX, CNAME, SOA, etc.,
                diagnosing name server problems.

                By default, nslookup will query
                the default name server but you can specify a
                different server on the command line or from a
                configuration file.  You can also specify
                different values for the options that control the
                resolver routines.

        MECHANISM
                The program formats, sends and receives DNS
                (RFC 1034) queries.

          Internet Tool Catalog                               OSITRACE

          NAME
               OSITRACE

          KEYWORDS
               traffic; OSI; eavesdrop; UNIX; free.

          ABSTRACT
               OSITRACE is a network performance tool that displays
               information about ISO TP4 connections.  One line of
               output is displayed for each packet indicating the
               time, source, destination, length, packet type,
               sequence number, credit, and any optional parameters
               contained in the packet.  Numerous options are avail-
               able to control the output of OSITRACE.

               To obtain packets to analyze, OSITRACE uses Sun
               Microsystems' Network Interface Tap (NIT) in SunOS 3.4,
               3.5, and 4.0.X.  OSITRACE may also obtain data from the
               NETMON utility which is described as another tool
               entry.

               In Sun systems, OSITRACE may be easily installed: OSI
               kernel support is not needed, nor is any other form of
               OSI software support.

          MECHANISM
               This tool has been designed in such a way that code to
               process different protocol suites may be easily added.
               As such, OSITRACE also has the ability to trace the DOD
               TCP protocols.

          CAVEATS
               None.

          NAME
               ping

          KEYWORDS
               generator, status; IP; ping; DOS, UNIX, VMS; free.

          ABSTRACT
               Ping is perhaps the most basic tool for internet
               management.  It verifies that a remote IP implementa-
               tion and the intervening networks and interfaces are
               functional.  It can be used to measure round trip
               delay.  Numerous versions of the ping program exist.

          MECHANISM
               Ping is based on the ICMP ECHO_REQUEST message.

          CAVEATS
               If run repeatedly, ping could generate high system
               loads.

          BUGS
               None known.

          LIMITATIONS
               PC/TCP's ping is the only implementation known support
               both loose and strict source routing.  Though some ping
               implementations support the ICMP "record route"
               feature, the usefulness of this option for debugging
               routes is limited by the fact that many gateways do not
               correctly implement it.

          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               No restrictions.

          SOFTWARE REQUIRED
               None.

          AVAILABILITY
               Ping is widely included in TCP/IP distributions.  Pub-
               lic domain versions of ping are available via anonymous
               FTP from uunet.uu.net, in directory bsd-
               sources/src/etc, and from venera.isi.edu, in directory

        ABSTRACT
                The SNMP agent listens for and responds to network
                management requests sent from SNMP-conforming network
                management stations.  The SNMP agent also sends SNMP
                traps, under specific conditions, to identified trap
                receivers.  SNMP communities and generation of traps
                are fully configurable.  The SNMP agent supports all
                MIB-II variables except the EGP group.

        MECHANISM
                Network management variables are made available for
                inspection and/or alteration by means of the Simple
                Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

        Internet Tool Catalog                                 PROXYD

        NAME
                proxyd -- SNMP proxy agent daemons from SNMP Research.

        KEYWORDS
                control, management, status;
                bridge, Ethernet, IP, OSI, ring, star;
                NMS, SNMP;
                UNIX;
                library, sourcelib.

        ABSTRACT
                SNMP proxy agents may be used to permit the monitoring
                and controlling of network elements which are otherwise
                not addressable using the SNMP management protocol
                (e.g., a network bridge that implements a proprietary
                management protocol).  Similarly, SNMP proxy agents may
                be used to protect SNMP agents from redundant network
                management agents through the use of caches.  Finally,
                SNMP proxy agents may be used to implement elaborate
                MIB access policies.

                The proxy agent daemon:

                - listens for SNMP queries and commands from logically
                  remote network management stations,
                - translates and retransmits those as appropriate
                  network management queries or cache lookups,
                - listens for and parses the responses,
                - translates the responses into SNMP responses, and
                - returns those responses as SNMP messages to the
                  network management station that originated the
                  transaction.

                The proxy agent daemon also emits SNMP traps to
                identified trap receivers.  The proxy agent daemon is
                designed to make the addition of additional vendor-
                specific variables a straight-forward task.  The proxy
                application comes complete with source code including a
                powerful set of portable libraries for generating and
                parsing SNMP messages and a set of command line utilities.

        MECHANISM
                Network management variables are made available for
                inspection and/or alteration by means of the Simple
                Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

        NAME
                proxyd -- SNMP proxy agent daemons from SNMP Research.

        KEYWORDS
                control, management, status;
                bridge, Ethernet, IP, OSI, ring, star;
                NMS, SNMP;
                UNIX;
                library, sourcelib.

        ABSTRACT
                SNMP proxy agents may be used to permit the monitoring
                and controlling of network elements which are otherwise
                not addressable using the SNMP management protocol
                (e.g., a network bridge that implements a proprietary
                management protocol).  Similarly, SNMP proxy agents may
                be used to protect SNMP agents from redundant network
                management agents through the use of caches.  Finally,
                SNMP proxy agents may be used to implement elaborate
                MIB access policies.

                The proxy agent daemon:

                - listens for SNMP queries and commands from logically
                  remote network management stations,
                - translates and retransmits those as appropriate
                  network management queries or cache lookups,
                - listens for and parses the responses,
                - translates the responses into SNMP responses, and
                - returns those responses as SNMP messages to the
                  network management station that originated the
                  transaction.

                The proxy agent daemon also emits SNMP traps to
                identified trap receivers.  The proxy agent daemon is
                designed to make the addition of additional vendor-
                specific variables a straight-forward task.  The proxy
                application comes complete with source code including a
                powerful set of portable libraries for generating and
                parsing SNMP messages and a set of command line utilities.

        MECHANISM
                Network management variables are made available for
                inspection and/or alteration by means of the Simple
                Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

          NAME
               query, ripquery

          KEYWORDS
               routing; IP; spoof; UNIX; free.

          ABSTRACT
               Query allows remote viewing of a gateway's routing
               tables.

          MECHANISM
               Query formats and sends a RIP request or POLL command
               to a destination gateway.

          CAVEATS
               Query is intended to be used a a tool for debugging
               gateways, not for network management.  SNMP is the pre-
               ferred protocol for network management.

          BUGS
               None known.

          LIMITATIONS
               The polled gateway must run RIP.

          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               No restriction.

          SOFTWARE REQUIRED
               4.3BSD UNIX or related OS.

          Internet Tool Catalog                                SNIFFER

          NAME
               Sniffer

          KEYWORDS
               analyzer, generator, traffic; DECnet, ethernet, IP,
               NFS, OSI, ring, SMTP, star; eavesdrop; standalone.

          ABSTRACT
               The Network General Sniffer is a protocol analyzer for
               performing LAN diagnostics, monitoring, traffic genera-
               tion, and troubleshooting.  The Sniffer protocol
               analyzer has the capability of capturing every packet
               on a network and of decoding all seven layers of the
               OSI protocol model.  Capture frame selection is based
               on several different filters: protocol content at lower
               levels; node addresses; pattern matching (up to 8
               logically-related patterns of 32 bytes each); and des-
               tination class.  Users may extend the protocol
               interpretation capability of the Sniffer by writing
               their own customized protocol interpreters and linking
               them to the Sniffer software.

               The Sniffer displays network traffic information and
               performance statistics in real time, in user-selectable
               formats.  Numeric station addresses are translated to
               symbolic names or manufacturer ID names.  Network
               activities measured include frames accepted, Kbytes
               accepted, and buffer use.  Each network version has
               additional counters for activities specific to that
               network.  Network activity is expressed as
               frames/second, Kbytes/second, or per cent of network
               bandwidth utilization.

               Data collection by the Sniffer may be output to printer
               or stored to disk in either print-file or spread-sheet
               format.

               Protocol suites understood by the Sniffer include:
               Banyan Vines, IBM Token-Ring, Novell Netware, XNS/MS-
               Net (3Com 3+), DECnet, TCP/IP (including SNMP and
               applications-layer protocols such as FTP, SMTP, and
               TELNET), X Windows (for X version 11), NFS, and several
               SUN proprietary protocols (including mount, pmap, RPC,
               and YP).  Supported LANs include: ethernet, Token-ring
               (4Mb and 16Mb versions), ARCNET, StarLAN, IBM PC Net-
               work (Broadband), and Apple Localtalk Network.

RFC 1470          FYI: Network Management Tool Catalog         June 1993


          MECHANISM
               The Sniffer is a self-contained, portable protocol
               analyzer that require only AC line power and connection
               to a network to operate.  Normally passive (except when
               in Traffic Generator mode), it captures images of all
               or of selected frames in a working buffer, ready for
               immediate analysis and display.

               The Sniffer is a standalone device.  Two platforms are
               available: one for use with single network topologies,
               the other for use with multi-network topologies.  Both
               include Sniffer core software, a modified network
               interface card (or multiple cards), and optional proto-
               col interpreter suites.

               All Sniffer functions may be remotely controlled from a
               modem-connected PC.  Output from the Sniffer can be
               imported to database or spreadsheet packages.

          CAVEATS
               In normal use, the Sniffer is a passive device, and so
               will not adversely effect network performance.  Perfor-
               mance degradation will be observed, of course, if the
               Sniffer is set to Traffic Generator mode and connected
               to an active network.

          BUGS
               None known.

          LIMITATIONS
               None reported.

          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               None.  The Sniffer is a self-contained unit, and
               includes its own interface card.  It installs into a
               network as would any normal workstation.

          SOFTWARE REQUIRED
               None.

          Internet Tool Catalog                   SNMP_DEVELOPMENT_KIT

          NAME
               The SNMP Development Kit

          KEYWORDS
               manager, status; IP; NMS, SNMP; UNIX; free, sourcelib.

          ABSTRACT
               The SNMP Development Kit comprises C Language source
               code for a programming library that facilitates access
               to the management services of the SNMP (RFC 1098).
               Sources are also included for a few simple client
               applications whose main purpose is to illustrate the
               use of the library.  Example client applications query
               remote SNMP agents in a variety of modes, and generate
               or collect SNMP traps.  Code for an example SNMP agent
               that supports a subset of the Internet MIB (RFC 1066)
               is also included.

          MECHANISM
               The Development Kit facilitates development of SNMP-
               based management applications -- both clients and
               agents.  Example applications execute SNMP management
               operations according to the values of command line
               arguments.

          CAVEATS
               None.

          BUGS
               Fixed in the next release.

          LIMITATIONS
               None reported.

          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               The SNMP library source code is highly portable and
               runs on a wide range of platforms.

          SOFTWARE REQUIRED
               The SNMP library source code has almost no operating
               system dependencies and runs in a wide range of
               environments.  Certain portions of the example SNMP
               agent code are specific to the 4.3BSD implementation of
               the UNIX system for the DEC MicroVAX.

                1)   to act as building blocks for the construction of
                     SNMP-based agent and manager applications; and

                2)   to act as network management tools for network
                     fire fighting and report generation.

                The libraries perform ASN.1 parsing and generation tasks
                for both network management station applications and
                network management agent applications.  These libraries
                hide the details of ASN.1 parsing and generation from
                application writers and make it unnecessary for them to
                be expert in these areas.  The libraries are very robust
                with considerable error checking designed in.  The
                several command line utilities include applications for
                retrieving one or many variables, retrieving tables, or
                effecting commands via the setting of remote network
                management variables.

        MECHANISM
                The parsing is performed via recursive descent methods.
                Messages are passed via the Simple Network Management
                Protocol (SNMP).

        CAVEATS
                None.

        BUGS
                None known.

        LIMITATIONS
                The monitored and managed nodes must implement the SNMP
                over UDP per RFC 1157 or must be reachable via a proxy
                agent.

        Internet Tool Catalog      SNMP_PACKAGED_AGENT_SNMP_RESEARCH

        NAME
                SNMP Packaged Agent System -- an SNMP host/gateway
                agent daemon including a complete protocol stack and
                runtime environment required to support an SNMP Agent
                from SNMP Research.

        KEYWORDS
                control, manager, status;
                bridge, Ethernet, FDDI, IP, OSI, ring, star;
                NMS, SNMP;
                DOS, standalone, UNIX;
                sourcelib.

        ABSTRACT
                The snmpd agent daemon listens for and responds to
                network management queries and commands from logically
                remote network management stations.  The agent daemon
                also emits SNMP traps to identified trap receivers.
                The agent daemon is designed to make the addition of
                additional vendor-specific variables a
                straight-forward task.  The snmpd application comes
                complete with source code including a powerful set of
                portable libraries for generating and parsing SNMP
                messages and a set of command line utilities.

                The Packaged Agent System is designed to aid the
                hardware manufacturer who is not experienced with the
                TCP/IP protocol suite.  A lightweight, non-preemptive
                scheduler/tasking system for faster execution and less
                impact on slow CPUs is included in the package.
                Development environment is either MS DOS or UNIX.

        MECHANISM
                Network management variables are made available for
                inspection and/or alteration by means of the Simple
                Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

        CAVEATS
                None.

        BUGS
                None known.

        LIMITATIONS

          Internet Tool Catalog                          SPIDERMONITOR

          NAME
               SpiderMonitor P220, K220 and
               SpiderAnalyzer P320, K320

          KEYWORDS
               alarm, analyzer, generator, traffic; DECnet, ethernet,
               IP, OSI; eavesdrop; standalone; sourcelib.

          ABSTRACT
               The SpiderMonitor and SpiderAnalyzer are protocol
               analyzers for performing ethernet LAN diagnostics, mon-
               itoring, traffic generation, and troubleshooting.  The
               SpiderMonitor has the capability of capturing every
               packet on a network and of decoding the first four
               layers of the OSI protocol model.  The SpiderAnalyzer
               has additional software for decoding higher protocol
               layers.  Protocol suites understood: TCP/IP (including
               SNMP and applications-layer protocols), OSI, XNS, DEC-
               net and IPX.  User-definable decodes can be written in
               'C' with the Microsoft version 5.0 'C' compiler.  A
               decode guide is provided.

               The SpiderAnalyzer supports multiple simultaneous
               filters for capturing packets using predefined patterns
               and error states.  Filter patterns can also trigger on
               NOT matching 1 or more filters, an alarm, or a speci-
               fied time.

               The SpiderAnalyzer can also employ TDR (Time Domain
               Reflectometry) to find media faults, open or short cir-
               cuits, or transceiver faults.  It can transmit OSI,
               XNS, and Xerox link-level echo packets to user-
               specified stations, performs loop round tests.

               In traffic generation mode, the SpiderAnalyzer has the
               ability to generate packets at random intervals of ran-
               dom lengths or any combination of random or fixed
               interval or length, generation of packets with CRC
               errors, or packets that are too short, or packets that
               are too long.

               Output from the SpiderMonitor/Analyzer can be imported
               to database or spreadsheet packages.

          MECHANISM
               The SpiderMonitor and Spider Analyzer are available as
               stand-alone, IBM PC compatible packages based upon a
               Compaq III portable system, or as a plug-in boards for
               any IBM XT/AT compatible machine.  The model 220 (Spi-
               derMonitor) systems provide a functional base suited
               for most network management needs.  The model 320 (Spi-
               derAnalyzer) systems provide extended functionality in
               the development mode and traffic generation mode as
               well more filtering capabilities than the 220 models.

          CAVEATS
               Traffic generation will congest an operational ether-
               net.

          BUGS
               None known.

          LIMITATIONS
               Monitoring of up to 1024 stations and buffering of up
               to 1500 packets.  The model 220 provides for 3 filters
               with a filter depth of 46 bytes.  The model 320 pro-
               vides for 4 filters and a second level of filtering
               with a filter depth of 64 bytes.

          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               PX20s are self contained, the KX20s require an IBM
               PC/XT-AT compatible machine with 5 megabytes of hard
               disk storage and the spare slot into which the board
               kit is plugged.

          SOFTWARE REQUIRED
               None.  The SpiderAnalyzer requires the Microsoft 'C'
               Compiler, Version 5.0 for writing user defined decodes.

          AVAILABILITY
               The SpiderMonitor/Analyzer is available commercially.

        Internet Tool Catalog                                  SPIMS

        NAME
                SPIMS -- the Swedish Institute of Computer Science
                         (SICS) Protocol Implementation Measurement
                         System tool.

        KEYWORDS
                benchmark, debugger; IP, OSI; spoof; UNIX.

        ABSTRACT
                SPIMS is used to measure the performance of protocol
                and "protocol-like" services including response time
                (two-way delay), throughput and the time to open and
                close connections.  It has been used to:

                o    benchmark alternative protocol implementations,

                o    observe how performance varies when parameters in
                        specific implementations have been varied (i.e.,
                        to tune parameters).

                SPIMS currently has interfaces to the DoD Internet Pro-
                tocols: UDP, TCP, FTP, SunRPC, the OSI protocols from
                the ISODE 4.0 distribution package: FTAM, ROSE, ISO TP0
                and to Sunlink 5.2 ISO TP4 as well as Stanford's VMTP.
                Also available are a rudimentary set of benchmarks,
                stubs for new protocol interfaces and a user manual.

                For an example of the use of SPIMS to tune protocols,
                see:

        MECHANISM
                SPIMS runs as user processes and uses a TCP connection
                for measurement set-up.  Measurements take place
                between processes over the measured protocol.  SPIMS
                generates messages and transfers them via the measured
                protocol service according to a user-supplied specifi-
                cation.  SPIMS has a unique measurement specification
                language that is used to specify a measurement session.
                In the language there are constructs for different
                application types (e.g., bulk data transfer), for
                specifying frequency and sequence of messages, for dis-
                tribution over message sizes and for combining basic
                specifications.  These specifications are independent
                of both protocols and protocol implementations and can
                be used for benchmarking.  For more details on the
                internals of SPIMS, see:

        AVAILABILITY AND CONTACT POINT FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THIS TOOL
                SPIMS is not in the public domain and the software is
                covered by licenses.  Use of the SPIMS software
                represents acceptance of the terms and conditions of
                the licenses.
                The licenses are enclosed in the distribution package.
                Licenses and SPIMS cover letter can also be obtained
                via an Internet FTP connection without getting the whole
                software.  The retrieval procedure is identical to the
                below university distribution via FTP.  The file to
                retrieve is pub/spims-dist/licenses.tar.Z

                There are two different distribution classes depending on
                requesting organization:

                1. Universities and non-profit organizations.

                To these organizations, SPIMS source code is distributed
                free of charge.  There are two ways to get the software:

                        1. FTP.
                        If you have an Internet FTP connection, you
                        can use anonymous FTP to sics.se
                        [192.16.123.90], and retrieve the file
                        pub/spims-dist/dist910304.tar.Z
                        (this is a .6MB compressed tar image) in
                        BINARY mode.  Log in as user anonymous and at
                        the password prompt, use your complete
                        electronic mail address.

          Internet Tool Catalog                              SPRAY_SUN

          NAME
               spray

          KEYWORDS
               benchmark, generator; IP; ping; UNIX.

          ABSTRACT
               Spray is a traffic generation tool that generates RPC
               or UDP packets, or ICMP Echo Requests.  The packets are
               sent to a remote procedure call application at the des-
               tination host.  The count of received packets is
               retrieved from the remote application after a certain
               number of packets have been transmitted.  The differ-
               ence in packets received versus packets sent represents
               (on a LAN) the packets that the destination host had to
               drop due to increasing queue length.  A measure of
               throughput relative to system speed and network load
               can thus be obtained.

          MECHANISM
               See above.

          CAVEATS
               Spray can congest a network.

          Internet Tool Catalog                                TCPDUMP

          NAME
               tcpdump

          KEYWORDS
               traffic; ethernet, IP, NFS; UNIX, VMS; free.

          ABSTRACT
               Tcpdump can interpret and print headers for the follow-
               ing protocols: ethernet, IP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, NFS, ND,
               ARP/RARP, AppleTalk.  Tcpdump has proven useful for
               examining and evaluating the retransmission and window
               management operations of TCP implementations.

          MECHANISM
               Much like etherfind, tcpdump writes a log file of the
               frames traversing an ethernet interface.  Each output
               line includes the time a packet is received, the type
               of packet, and various values from its header.

          CAVEATS
               None.

          BUGS
               None known.

          LIMITATIONS
               Public domain version requires a kernel patch for
               SunOS. TCPware for VMS - currently interprets headers
               for IP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP only.

          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               Any Ultrix system (VAX or DEC RISC hardware)

          SOFTWARE REQUIRED
               Ultrix release 4.0 or later.  For Ultrix 4.1, may
               require the patched "if_ln.o" kernel module, available
               from Digital's Customer Support Center.

          NAME
               tcplogger

          KEYWORDS
               traffic; IP; eavesdrop; UNIX; free.

          ABSTRACT
               Tcplogger consists of modifications to the 4.3BSD UNIX
               source code, and a large library of post-processing
               software.  Tcplogger records timestamped information
               from TCP and IP packets that are sent and received on a
               specified connection.  For each TCP packet, information
               such as sequence number, acknowledgement sequence
               number, packet size, and header flags is recorded.  For
               an IP packet, header length, packet length and TTL
               values are recorded.  Customized use of the TCP option
               field allows the detection of lost or duplicate pack-
               ets.

          MECHANISM
               Routines of 4.3BSD UNIX in the netinet directory have
               been modified to append information to a log in memory.
               The log is read continuously by a user process and
               written to a file.  A TCP option has been added to
               start the logging of a connection.  Lots of post-
               processing software has been written to analyze the
               data.

          CAVEATS
               None.

          BUGS
               None known.

          LIMITATIONS
               To get a log at both ends of the connection, the modi-
               fied kernel should be run at both the hosts.

               All connections are logged in a single file, but
               software is provided to filter out the record of a sin-
               gle connection.

          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               No restrictions.

          Internet Tool Catalog                             TRACEROUTE

          NAME
               traceroute

          KEYWORDS
               routing; IP; ping; UNIX, VMS; free.

          ABSTRACT
               Traceroute is a tool that allows the route taken by
               packets from source to destination to be discovered.
               It can be used for situations where the IP record route
               option would fail, such as intermediate gateways dis-
               carding packets, routes that exceed the capacity of an
               datagram, or intermediate IP implementations that don't
               support record route.  Round trip delays between the
               source and intermediate gateways are also reported
               allowing the determination of individual gateways con-
               tribution to end-to-end delay.

               Enhanced versions of traceroute have been developed
               that allow specification of loose source routes for
               datagrams.  This allows one to investigate the return
               path from remote machines back to the local host.

          MECHANISM
               Traceroute relies on the ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED error
               reporting mechanism.  When an IP packet is received by
               an gateway with a time-to-live value of 0, an ICMP
               packet is sent to the host which generated the packet.
               By sending packets to a destination with a TTL of 0,
               the next hop can be identified as the source of the
               ICMP TIME EXCEEDED message.  By incrementing the TTL
               field the subsequent hops can be identified.  Each
               packet sent out is also time stamped.  The time stamp
               is returned as part of the ICMP packet so a round trip
               delay can be calculated.

          CAVEATS
               Some IP implementations forward packets with a TTL of
               0, thus escaping identification.  Others use the TTL
               field in the arriving packet as the TTL for the ICMP
               error reply, which delays identification.

               Sending datagrams with the source route option will
               cause some gateways to crash.  It is considered poor
               form to repeat this behavior.

          BUGS
               None known.

          LIMITATIONS
               Most versions of UNIX have errors in the raw IP code
               that require kernel mods for the standard version of
               traceroute to work.  A version of traceroute exists
               that runs without kernel mods under SunOS 3.5 (see
               below), but it only operates over an ethernet inter-
               face.

          HARDWARE REQUIRED

          Internet Tool Catalog                                   TRPT

          NAME
               TRPT -- transliterate protocol trace

          KEYWORDS
               traffic; IP; eavesdrop; UNIX; free.

          ABSTRACT
               TRPT displays a trace of a TCP socket events.  When no
               options are supplied, TRPT prints all the trace records
               found in a system, grouped according to TCP connection
               protocol control block (PCB).

               An example of TRPT output is:

               38241 ESTABLISHED:input
               [e0531003..e0531203)@6cc5b402(win=4000)<ACK> -> ESTA-
               BLISHED
               38241 ESTABLISHED:user RCVD -> ESTABLISHED
               38266 ESTABLISHED:output
               6cc5b402@e0531203(win=4000)<ACK> -> ESTABLISHED
               38331 ESTABLISHED:input
               [e0531203..e0531403)@6cc5b402(win=4000)<ACK,FIN,PUSH>
               -> CLOSE_WAIT
               38331 CLOSE_WAIT:output
               6cc5b402@e0531404(win=3dff)<ACK> -> CLOSE_WAIT
               38331 CLOSE_WAIT:user RCVD -> CLOSE_WAIT
               38343 LAST_ACK:output
               6cc5b402@e0531404(win=4000)<ACK,FIN> -> LAST_ACK
               38343 CLOSE_WAIT:user DISCONNECT -> LAST_ACK
               38343 LAST_ACK:user DETACH -> LAST_ACK

          MECHANISM
               TRPT interrogates the buffer of TCP trace records that
               is created when a TCP socket is marked for debugging.

          CAVEATS
               Prior to using TRPT, an analyst should take steps to
               isolate the problem connection and find the address of
               its protocol control blocks.

          BUGS
               None reported.

          LIMITATIONS
               A socket must have the debugging option set for TRPT to
               operate.  Another problem is that the output format of
               TRPT is difficult.

          Internet Tool Catalog                         UNISYS-PARAMAX

          NAME
                Paramax Network Security Server

          KEYWORDS
                alarm, control, manager, security, status;
                ethernet, FDDI, IP; X; UNIX.

          ABSTRACT
                The Paramax Network Security Server (NSS) is a
                security officer's tool for centralized security
                management of TCP/IP-based networks.  The NSS provides
                capability for collection, on-line storage,
                maintenance, and correlation of audit data from hosts,
                workstations, servers, and network devices.  Through
                the X window based user interface, a security officer
                can review and analyze this audit data at the NSS,
                select and request filtered portions of host audit
                data, and receive and analyze security alerts from
                across the network.  The NSS supports centralized
                access control of network resources through its
                capability to create and update user and host access
                permissions data.  The user access permissions data
                identifies network addresses that each user is
                permitted to access.  The host access permissions data
                identifies network addresses between which
                communication is permitted.  The NSS supports
                centralized management of user authentication data
                (user IDs and passwords) and other user data for use
                by hosts, workstations, and servers in the network.
                It generates pseudo-random pronounceable passwords for
                selection and assignment to users by the security officer.

                The NSS deadman timer locks the NSS screen or logs the
                security officer off the NSS after periods of
                inactivity.  A biometric authentication device is
                optional for rigorous fingerprint authentication of
                users at the NSS, and logins to the NSS itself are
                permitted only at the console.  The NSS currently
                provides centralized security management for a System High
                Network.  It is being upgraded for a Compartmented Mode
                environment.

          MECHANISM
                The NSS uses the Audit Information Transfer Protocol
                (AITP) for the transfer of security alerts and audit
                data.  AITP is NOT proprietary, and the specification
                is available from the address listed below.  Access to
                the NSS audit database is provided via the Structured
                Query Language (SQL).

        NAME
                Management Station, Release 3.0

        KEYWORDS
                manager; ; snmp, x; sun, dec, dos;.

        ABSTRACT
                Management Station is a network management software
                product that supports SNMP.  Release 3.0 implements a
                distributed network management architecture that helps
                solve the scalability and reliability limitations of
                using a single cpu for all SNMP management tasks.
                Additionally, there are many applications provided
                that are all user-configurable.  The following
                applications and their functionality is listed below:

                General Info:

                X Windows, 11.4 based implemented with OSF/Motif 1.1.1
                toolkit.  X Windows interface for all configuration
                files.  Most applications have "verbose" mode for
                display of SNMP PDU traffic.  On-line help and
                Reference manual pages.  ANSI C compliant.

                Network Management Daemon:

                Responsible for device discovery, trap/alarm
                management and fault monitoring for the network map.
                Connection with other distributed daemons and any
                connected stations is accomplished with SNMP/TCP.
                Configured via Manager MIB; also incorporates SMUX MIB
                (RFC 1227).  Sends any information to INGRES, Oracle
                or Sybase via an ESQL interface.  User-defined actions
                include: send alarm to map; send info to flat file;
                execute ESQL command; call any UNIX system command;
                forward traps and filter user-defined alarms.
                User-defined alarms can use any boolean expression and
                MIB variable expressions can be combined with AND/OR
                statements.

                MIB Compiler

                ASN.1 MIB compiler with X Windows interface.  Accepts
                RFC 1155 and 1212 format.  Most vendor-specific MIBs
                and proposed Internet standard MIBs already included.

        KEYWORDS
                database, manager, map, monitoring, status; IP; Ping,
                SNMP, Unix, X; free.

        ABSTRACT
                Xnetdb is a network monitoring tool based on X Windows
                and SNMP which also has integrated database and
                statistic viewing capabilities.  Xnetdb will determine
                and display the status of routers and circuits it has
                been told to monitor by querying the designated sites
                and displaying the result.  It can also query the
                status of certain designated SNMP variables, such as a
                default route for an important router.  Additionally,
                it also has integrated database functionality in that
                it can display additional information about a site or
                circuit such as the equipment at the site, the contact
                person(s) for the site, and other useful information.
                Finally it can gather designated statistical
                information about a circuit and display it on demand.

        MECHANISM
                Xnetdb uses SNMP or ping to monitor things which its
                configured to monitor.  It dynamically builds a
                network map on its display by querying entities and
                obtaining IP addresses and subnet masks.  A
                configuration file tells xnetdb which IP hosts you
                want to monitor.

        CAVEATS
                While "ping" can be used to monitor hosts, more useful
                results are obtained using SNMP.

        BUGS
                Bugs and other assorted topics are discussed on the

        NAME
                XNETMON -- an X windows based SNMP network management
                station from SNMP Research.

        KEYWORDS
                alarm, benchmark, control, debugger, manager, map,
                reference, security, status, traffic;

                NMS, Ping, SNMP, X;
                UNIX;
                Sourcelib.

        ABSTRACT
                The XNETMON application implements a powerful network
                management station based on the X window system.
                XNETMON's network management tools for configuration,
                performance, security, and fault management have been
                used successfully with a wide assortment of wide- and
                local-area-network topologies and medias.
                Multiprotocol devices are supported
                including those using TCP/IP, DECnet, and OSI
                protocols.

        Some features of XNETMON's network management tools include:

                o Fault management tool displays a map of the network
                  configuration with node and link state indicated
                  in one of several colors to indicate current status;
                o Configuration management tool may be used to edit the
                  network management information base stored in the
                  NMS to reflect changes occurring in the network;
                o Graphs and tabular tools for use in fault and performance
                  management (e.g. XNETPERFMON);
                o Mechanisms by which additional variables, such as vendor-
                  specific variables, may be added;
                o Alarms may be enabled to alert the operator of events
                  occurring in the network;
                o Events are logged to disk;
                o Output data may be transferred via flat files for
                  additional report generation by a variety of
                  statistical packages.

                The XNETMON application comes complete with source
                code including a powerful set of portable libraries
                for generating and parsing SNMP messages.

        MECHANISM
                XNETMON is based on the Simple Network Management
                Protocol (SNMP).  Polling is performed via the
                powerful SNMP get-next operator and the SNMP get
                operator.  Trap-directed polling is used to regulate
                        focus and intensity of the polling.

        CAVEATS
                None.

        BUGS
                None known.

        LIMITATIONS
                Monitored and managed nodes must implement the SNMP over
                UDP per RFC 1157 or must be reachable via a proxy agent.

        HARDWARE REQUIRED
                X windows workstation with UDP socket library.
                Monochrome is acceptable, but color is far superior.

        SOFTWARE REQUIRED
                X windows version 11 release 4 or later or MOTIF.

          Internet Tool Catalog                      XNETMON_WELLFLEET

          NAME
               xnetmon, xpmon

          KEYWORDS
               alarm, manager, map, status; IP; NMS, SNMP; UNIX.

          ABSTRACT
               Xnetmon and xpmon provide graphical representation of
               performance and status of SNMP-capable network ele-
               ments.  Xnetmon presents a schematic network map
               representing the up/down status of network elements;
               xpmon draws a pen plot style graph of the change over
               time of any arbitrary MIB object (RFC1066).  Both xnet-
               mon and xpmon use the SNMP (RFC1098) for retrieving
               status and performance data.

          MECHANISM
               Xnetmon polls network elements for the status of their
               interfaces on a controllable polling interval.  Pop-up
               windows displaying the values of any MIB variable are
               supported by separate polls.  When SNMP traps are
               received from a network element, that element and all
               adjacent elements are immediately re-polled to update
               their status.  The layout of the network map is stati-
               cally configured.  Xpmon repeatedly polls (using SNMP)
               the designated network element for the value of the
               designated MIB variable on the user-specified interval.
               The change in the variable is then plotted on the strip
               chart.  The strip chart regularly adjusts its scale to
               the current maximum value on the graph.

          CAVEATS
               Polling intervals should be chosen with care so as not
               to affect system performance adversely.

          BUGS
               None known.

          LIMITATIONS
               None reported.

          HARDWARE REQUIRED
               Distributed and supported for Sun-3 systems.

          SOFTWARE REQUIRED
               SunOS 3.5 or 4.x; X11, release 2 or 3.

        Internet Tool Catalog              XNETPERFMON_SNMP_RESEARCH

        NAME
                xnetperfmon -- a graphical network performance and
                fault management tool from SNMP Research.

        KEYWORDS
                manager, security, status;
                DECnet, Ethernet, IP, OSI, ring, star;
                NMS, SNMP, X;
                DOS, UNIX, VMS;
                sourcelib.

        ABSTRACT
                Xnetperfmon is a XNETMON tool used to produce plots of
                SNMP variables in graphical displays.  The manager may
                easily customize the labels, step size, update interval,
                and variables to be plotted to produce graphs for fault
                and performance management.  Scales automatically adjust
                whenever a point to be plotted would go off scale.

        MECHANISM
                The xnetperfmon application communicates with remote
                agents or proxy agents via the Simple Network Management
                Protocol (SNMP).

        CAVEATS
                All plots for a single invocation of xnetperfmon must be
                for variables provided by a single network management
                agent.  However, multiple invocations of xnetperfmon may
                be active on a single display simultaneously or proxy
                agents may be used to summarize information at a common
                point.

        BUGS
                None known.

        LIMITATIONS
                None reported.

        HARDWARE REQUIRED
                Systems supporting X windows.

        SOFTWARE REQUIRED
                XNETMON from SNMP Research and X Version 11 release 4 or
                later (option MOTIF)

NFSTRACE

   This is the rpcspy/nfstrace package.

   It is described in detail in the paper "NFS Tracing by Passive
   Network Monitoring", which appeared in the January, 1992 USENIX
   conference.

   You'll need either a DEC machine running ULTRIX (with the
   packetfilter installed in the kernel) or a Sun running SunOS 4.x
   (with NIT).  Or you'll need to do a bit of hacking.

   The package differs slightly from the version in the paper:


   - The handle->name translation facility has been removed.  It's
     just too fragile to include in the general release.  If you need it,
     contact me directly and I'll be happy to mail you the code.

   - The output format is a wee-bit different.

   - The IBM-RT Enet filter version is also not included, since I seem to
     be the only person in the world running it.  RTs are really too slow
     for this anyway.

   To configure the package, edit the makefile in the obvious (to me at
   least) way.

   Note that the not all versions of SunOS NIT have working versions of
   the packet timestamp mechanism.  Try to set the -DSTAMPS option in
   the makefile, and if that doesn't work, take it out.

   If you are actually going to use this to gather traces, I'd like to
   hear from you! Please send email, and share your results/traces if
   your organization will allow it.  I maintain a mailing list of users
   for updates, etc.  Send me mail to be added to it.

   Happy tracing.

     It gets this information from a set of interconnected
     servers that are spread across the world.  By default, it
     simply converts between host names and Internet addresses.
     However, with the -t, -a and -v options, it can be used to
     find all of the information about hosts or domains that is
     maintained by the domain nameserver.

PINGs

Many many versions of the PING program exist.
Each implementation has its own set of additional features.
Here are a few more PINGs that are worth taking a look at.

Version on ftp.cc.berkeley.edu:pub/ping:
        This version has duplicate packet detection, Record Route,
        ability to specify data pattern for packets, flood pinging, an
        interval option, Multicast support, etc.

Version on nikhefh.nikhef.nl:/pub/network/rping.tar.Z:
        'rping' is just like 'ping', but only a single probe packet
        is sent to test the reachability of a destination.
        As an option, the loose source routing facility is used
        to show the roundtrip route the packet has taken.
        Multiple addresses of remote hosts are tried until one
        responds. As an option, each of multiple addresses can be
        probed unconditionally.
        Contains a patch for making loose source routing work in
        case you have a SUN with an OMNINET ethernet controller.

VRFY

vrfy.tar.Z      (Version 921021)
        'vrfy' is a tool to verify email addresses and mailing lists.
        In its simplest form it takes an address "user@domain", figures
        out the MX hosts for "domain", and issues the SMTP command VRFY
        at the primary MX host (optionally all), or at "domain" itself
        if no MX hosts exist. Without "domain" it goes to "localhost".
        More complex capabilities are: recursively expanding forward
        files or mailing lists, and detecting mail forwarding loops.
        Full-blown RFC822 address specifications are understood.
        Syntax checking can be carried out either locally or remotely.
        Various options are provided to exploit alternative protocol
        suites if necessary, and to print many forms of verbose output.
        Obvious limitations exist, but on average it works pretty well.
        Needless to say you need internet (nameserver and SMTP) access.
        See the man page and the extensive documentation in the source
        for further details.

XNETLOAD

NAME
     xnetload - ethernet load average display for X

SYNOPSIS
     xnetload[-toolkitoption ...] [-scale integer]
           [-update seconds] [-hl color] [-highlight color]
           [-jumpscroll pixels] [-label string] [-nolabel] host

DESCRIPTION
     The xnetload program displays a periodically updating histo-
     gram  of  the  ethernet load average for the specified host.
     The resulting graph is  scaled  as  0%  to  100%,  where  0%
     corresponds  to  0mbs  and 100% corresponds to 10mbs.  NOTE:
     The specified host must be running rpc.etherd.

This program has been run using X11R4 and X11R5, under the following
operating systems:

        SUNOS 4.1.0
        SUNOS 4.1.1
        ULTRIX V4.2
        IRIX 3.3.2

Assuming the Imake templates and Rules are in order and in the proper
place on your system, these programs should compile and link
straightforward by running the following sequence:

        xmkmf
        make

Then, as root, issue the following:

        make install
        make install.man

Then, on your host system, (or on any other system you can rlogin or rsh
into) start the etherd daemon with the following (must be root):

        /usr/etc/rpc.etherd le0 &

where le0 is the mnemonic for the primary ethernet interface.

To start the xnetload program, the following command line is suggested:

        ./xnetload -hl red host &

RFC 1470          FYI: Network Management Tool Catalog         June 1993


where "host" is the name of any reachable network node (including
LOCALHOST) that is running the etherd daemon. A small xload window
should appear on your local display with nine horizontal lines. The
label:
        "Ethernet Load %"
should appear in the upper left hand corner, just below any additional
title bars or other decorations provided by your window manager. If the
program comes up without the nine lines, or without the "Ethernet Load"
label, then either your resource file is not properly installed in the
appropriate app-defaults directory, or you may have picked up the wrong
xnetload image.  Try re-running "make install" as root, or be sure to
include the "./" in front of the command name.

Good Luck!

The following changes have been made to this directory since R3:

      o Now use Athena StripChart widget.

      o Understands WM_DELETE_WINDOW.

NETTEST

     nettest, nettestd - Performs client and server functions for
     timing data throughput

     The nettest and nettestd commands invoke client  and  server
     programs that are used for timing data throughput of various
     methods of interprocess communication.  For TCP and OSI con-
     nections,  the nettest program establishes a connection with
     the nettestd program, and then it does count writes of  size
     bytes,  followed by count reads of size bytes.  For UDP, the
     nettest program performs only writes;  reads  are  not  per-
     formed.  The nettestd program, if used with UDP connections,
     reads the data packets and prints a message  for  each  data
     packet  it  receives.   The number and size of the reads and
     writes may not correlate with the number  and  size  of  the
     actual  data packets that are transferred; it depends on the
     protocol that is chosen.  If you append an optional k (or K)
     to  the  size, count, or bufsize value, the number specified
     is multiplied by 1024.

   This source for nettest and nettestd are provided on an "as is"
   basis.  Cray Research does not provide any support for this code
   (unless you are a customer who has purchased the UNICOS operating
   system).

   We will gladly take bug reports for nettest/nettestd.  Suggested
   fixes are prefered to just bug reports.  Changes to allow
   nettest/nettestd to run on other architectures are also welcomed.  We
   will try to incorporate bugfixes and update the publicly available
   code, but we can make no guarantees.

   For copyright information, see the notice in each source file.

   Notes:

   1) The -b option to nettestd has not been tested...
   2) The ISO code should work on a 4.4BSD system, but the
      gethostinfo() routine is specific to UNICOS...

   ETHERCK

   etherck is a simple program that displays Sun ethernet statistics.
   If you have a high percents of input errors that are due to "out of
   buffers", then you can run the "iepatch" script to patch a kernel
   that uses the Intel ethernet chip ("ie").  A back of the envelope
   calculation shows that a .25% input error rate gives about a 10%
   degradation of NFS performance if 8k packets are being used.

   In our environment at Legato, patching the ie buffer allocation made
   the input error rate drop more than 2 orders of magnitude.  This was
   after we had applied other networking fixes (e.g., using Prestoserve,
   going from thin wire to twisted pair) and pushed a higher load on the
   server.

   Note that both etherck and iepatch must be run by root (or you can
   make etherck setgid kmem).

   Availability:
           send EMAIL to:          request@legato.com
           with a Subject line:    send unsupported etherck

   The following is part of the 'help' file from the Legato Email
   Server:

   This message comes to you from the request server at Legato.COM,
   request@Legato.COM.  It received a message from you asking for help.

   The request server is a mail-response program.  That means that you
   mail it a request, and it mails back the response.

   The request server is a very dumb program.  It does not have much
   error checking.  If you don't send it the commands that it
   understands, it will just answer "I don't understand you".

   The request server has 4 commands.  Each command must be the first
   word on a line.  The request server reads your entire message before
   it does anything, so you can have several different commands in a
   single message.  The request server treats the "Subject:" header line
   just like any other line of the message.  You can use any combination
   of upper and lower case letters in the commands.

   The request server's files are organized into a series of directories
   and subdirectories.  Each directory has an index, and each
   subdirectory has an index.  The top-level index gives you an overview
   of what is in the subdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory
   tells you what is in it.

   The server has 4 commands:

   "help" command: The command "help" or "send help" causes the server to
           send you the help file.  You already know this, of course,
           because you are reading the help file.  No other commands are
           honored in a message that asks for help (the server figures
           that you had better read the help message before you do
           anything else).

   SEND a request to Legato to get the rest of the help file!

   NETCK

   netck is a shar file that contains the sources to build "netck", a
   network checker that uses the rstat(3R) protocol to gather and print
   statistics from machines on the network.  netck is useful to help
   understand what part of what machines are potential NFS bottlenecks.
   To get this file, send email to the request server with the command
   "send unsupported netck".
